            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Friends and Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>UNder Chriſt, (whoſe I deſire chiefly to be, and whom I would firſtly ſerve) you are neareſt to me in ſpiritual relation, and deareſt in Chriſtian affection, having, upon your call and invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto, given my ſelf to the ſervice of your Souls; and though through much infirmity, I have
<pb facs="tcp:33830:4"/>preached the Goſpel to you, (being the moſt unworthy of them who Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in holy things) yet my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you have not deſpiſed nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, but received me as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of God, yea, even as Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: And though I have ſpent nigh Eighteen years amongſt many of you, yet I have not reaſon to put that queſtion to you, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> did unto his <hi>Galatians, Where is then the bleſſedneſs you ſpeak of?</hi> For your reſpects to me and my weak endeavours, continue freſh and vigorous at this day, even as at the firſt. To ſome of you I am obliged in many bonds of gratitude, to all in love and duty; to others I owe much, to you my ſelf; and therefore I could make a dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Diſcourſes to none ſo
<pb facs="tcp:33830:4"/>fitly as your ſelves. The many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in them, may render them contemptible to others, yet I know your love will cover my defects, and will receive them with as much candour and kindneſs from the Preſs, as you did attend them with diligence and affection in the Preaching of them; eſpecially, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that ſome of you importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me to it, judging them ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; I cannot eaſily wiſh the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject treated of greater or better, but the manner of explaining and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying theſe excellent Promiſes, I could deſire were much better for your ſakes: But where there is a willing mind, it is accepted with Chriſt, and I doubt not but you will be conformable to his example in this particular.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:33830:5"/>
            <p>As the following Sermons were at firſt Preached for your inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and now publiſhed for your edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; ſo let them be well digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by meditation, and practiſed in your converſation. You are called a Church of Chriſt. O ſtudy to be ſo indeed, <hi>viz.</hi> A Congregation of faithful ones; faithful to God, and with the Saints. Be not like <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> declining, in your love and firſt works; or if you be abated therein, remember whence you are fallen, and labour to recover. Be not like <hi>Pergamos</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> ſeduced by erronious Principles, or debauched by evil Practiſes: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, be not like <hi>Laodicea,</hi> ſelf-conceited, and proud of your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments and enjoyments, or luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm in the great things of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:33830:5"/>for ſuch are loathſom to the heart and ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt: But be you a ſweet-ſmelling <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> let the ſavour of Chriſts good Ointments be manifeſted in all your words and ways; and ſhew your ſelves <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> of humble, meek, loving diſpoſitions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, unto all the Saints, yea, even unto all men.</p>
            <p>In a word, Labour to approve your ſelves good Soldiers of Jeſus Chriſt; look to him who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and finiſher of your faith: yield not to, compound not with, fly not from your ſpiritual enemies, but reſiſt ſtedfaſtly, for Chriſt ſtands by you, fights for you, and will give victory to you in the end. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the ancient Britiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they never ran away in
<pb facs="tcp:33830:6"/>Battel, till their General firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook them: Let us all demean our ſelves valiantly in our Chriſtian warfare, till Chriſt the Captain of our ſalvation deſert us; which will never be, for we have his faithful Promiſe, ſaying, <hi>I will never leave you nor forſake you:</hi> To his bleſſing and holy protection I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you, deſiring the continuance of your Prayers for me, and your acceptance of this ſmall teſtimony of my reſpects to you, by which I may ſpeak to you, when I ſhall go from hence and be ſeen no more. <hi>I am</hi>

               <salute>Chriſtian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE end of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing theſe few Lines to the following Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, is not becauſe I think they need any commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or atteſtation from me, or that any thing I can ſay of them will render them at all the more acceptable to any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe hands they may come (for I doubt not but they will
<pb facs="tcp:33830:7"/>approve themſelves to every ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, intelligent, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally minded Reader) but only to anſwer the deſires of my dear and worthy friend the Author of them. As to this Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> (the precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the Seven <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, in the ſecond and third Chapters thereof, being the foundation of the enſuing diſcourſes) it hath been obſerved by ſome, that it is Symbolical and Prophetical, containing in it Predictions of many things to come both in the Church and in the World, ſymbolically repreſented; ſo that the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> as in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel he appeareth to be an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, in his Epiſtles an Apoſtle, ſo in this his <hi>Revelation</hi> a Prophet.
<pb facs="tcp:33830:7"/>It is indeed penned in ſomewhat obſcure phraſes, borrowed ſome of them from the Prophets of old; whence the underſtanding of it (at leaſt of ſome part of it) have been found difficult e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the godly learned: thence ſome have refuſed to read it pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, others have declined the publick reading of it; others have forborn to expound it, and ſome have refrained from Preaching out of it: yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the holy Scripture, dictated by the Spirit of God for the inſtruction and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church in theſe laſt and worſt days (and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo ſuch a gracious promiſe of bleſſing made to the reading and hearing the words of it, but
<pb facs="tcp:33830:8"/>eſpecially to the keeping the things written therein, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.3.) I cannot but judge the labours of thoſe much to be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who have, either by their Sermons, or Interpretations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured the elucidation and illuſtration of it: And that the Author of theſe following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes hath by the gracious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and guidance of the Lords holy Spirit, been directed to the true and genuine ſenſe and meaning of the ſame Spirit, in thoſe choice and precious promiſes whereof he treats. As to the ſubject matters contained in theſe promiſes here diſcourſed, I look upon them as ſome of the moſt neceſſary and ſubſtantial truths of the Goſpel; for what
<pb facs="tcp:33830:8"/>indeed can be more neceſſary, profitable and uſeful to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, than the right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the moſt precious and glorious promiſes thereof? thoſe exceeding great and precious promiſes, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. which are as ſo many breaſts full of ſweetneſs and conſolation to all the heirs of them. The new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to which all the Promiſes relate, and in which they are all contained (called therefore the Covenant of Promiſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12.) and which differs not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but intellectually only from them; the Covenant being the whole of the Promiſes, and the Promiſes the parts of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; I ſay, this new Covenant,
<pb facs="tcp:33830:9"/>containing in it the moſt bleſſed and glorious diſcovery of that wonderful myſtery, of the ever-to-be adored grace of God to ſinners in Jeſus Chriſt the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator thereof, about their redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and ſalvation, the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereof muſt needs be moſt refreſhing and conſolatory to all the heirs of them; amongſt whom, Reader, if thou beeſt one, I doubt not but thou wilt find a ſweet ſavour and ſpiritual reliſh in theſe diſcourſes; for they breathe forth nothing but love and ſweetneſs, pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to thoſe that are Overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as all the heirs of Promiſe ſhall at laſt aſſuredly be.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable in all theſe Promiſes, that though they are
<pb facs="tcp:33830:9"/>in the concluſion of the Epiſtles to ſeveral Churches, yet they are all made to the ſame perſons, <hi>vid.</hi> to Overcomers; now victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, at leaſt in the ſpiritual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, ſuppoſeth a fight, conqueſt a combat; they only ſhall obtain the conqueſt over all their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual enemies, who have ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly maintained the combat with them, and that to the end: Here therefore thou art directed ſo to fight the good fight of faith, as that at laſt thou maiſt fully lay hold of, and be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with eternal life.</p>
            <p>As to the manner of handling theſe things, I ſhall only ſay, that I judge the Author hath through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Diſcourſe, taken <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:33830:10"/>2.15. <hi>vid.</hi> ſtudied to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf approved unto God, and as to men he hath ſhewn himſelf a workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of Truth; in his Doctrine ſhewing uncorruptneſs, gravity, ſincerity, as the ſame Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts <hi>Titus, Tit.</hi> 2.7, 8. uſing ſound ſpeech that cannot be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and as the ſame Apoſtle alſo ſpeaks of himſelf and the other Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. ſpeaking of theſe great things, not in the words which mans wiſdom teacheth, but which the holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things with ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>This little veſſel (I aſſure thee Reader) brings thee Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, not Apes and Peacocks, as
<pb facs="tcp:33830:10"/>ſome of the Veſſels of <hi>Solomons Tharſhiſh</hi> Navy did of old, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.22. Here are no empty notions, airy ſpeculations, jingling and rhyming phraſes, or ſuch phantaſtical things; but ſound and wholeſom practical Divinity: not a flood of words, and a drop of matter; not <hi>vox &amp; praeterea nihil,</hi> but <hi>multum in parvo,</hi> much in a little; the moſt excellent, neceſſary and ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth proſpicuouſly opened, and as pertinently and profitably applied. Whouldeſt thou then know who are thy worſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? how thou maiſt ſo fight againſt them as to overcome them? what it is to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God?

            <p>IT hath ſeemed good to the alwiſe God, that our lot ſhould be to live in theſe laſt and worſt of days; In which, our Gracious God is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in the ways of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe providence in order to the fulfilling of his good Word; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, our Lord hath frequently fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned us of many tribulations that his followers (if they will be
<pb facs="tcp:33830:12"/>faithful) muſt meet with, <hi>Joh. 16.33.</hi> in this World; alſo the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> from his own abundant experience telleth us, <hi>2</hi> Tim. <hi>2.12. That they who will live godly in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecutions.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> in like manner tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, Acts <hi>14.22.</hi> That <hi>through much tribulation we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Kingdom of God.</hi> To the end, that we being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned, might be forearmed; and that when theſe things ſhall come to paſs, we might not be anxiously troubled.</p>
            <p>The ſad experience of the Church of Chriſt, in all ages do abundantly ſeal to this; and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even in our preſent time it may truly be ſaid, that this
<pb facs="tcp:33830:13"/>day theſe Scriptures are fulfilling in our eyes.</p>
            <p>The Woman is now, <hi>Rev. 12.16.</hi> forced to flie into the Wilderneſs, as formerly ſhe did in thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive days, being conſtrained for to wander up and down in Deſerts, and in Mountains, and hi Caves of the Earth: But the ſame God, who then not only took care of the Manchild, but of the Mother al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, providing and preparing a place for her, where ſhe was nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and fed; I ſay, the ſame God, who hath preſerved her, he doth ſtill preſerve, and will preſerve her, even to his Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>And although that great red Draggon, the Devil and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, <hi>viz.</hi> Papiſts and Atheiſts,
<pb facs="tcp:33830:13"/>are continually caſting forth, <hi>Rev. 12.15.</hi> floods of Reproaches, Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Callumninations after her, that (if poſſible) they might carry her away; yet God will ſtir up ſome who ſhall help her, though but earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded, and ſelf-ended in what they do: And though he ſhould proceed on to make war with her, yet ſhall he not overcome; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Troop ſhall follow her, yet ſhe ſhall overcome at the laſt.</p>
            <p>And though this Lion roareth and rageth at her, having great wrath, becauſe his time is ſhort; yet ſhall the Lion of the tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> tread him under his feet.</p>
            <p>How be it, <hi>Pſal. 74.9.</hi> As ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Church of Chriſt, being under great perſecutions, groaned under this as agravating of her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
<pb facs="tcp:33830:14"/>that ſhe ſaw not her ſigns of deliverance out of captivity, neither was there amongſt them a Prophet, or any that knew how long; even ſo, ſuch is our caſe at this day. Nevertheleſs, ſeeing that the Viſion is but for an appointed time, our duty is, to wait upon God, and to keep his way; being confident concerning this, That the time is not very far off, when God will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ſay to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that her ſins are pardoned, and her war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare is accompliſhed; his thoughts to her ward, being thoughts of peace, to give her an expected end.</p>
            <p>And in the mean time, we are to ſtand and admire at the great goodneſs of our God; That in ſuch a day as this is, when the moſt of the Sons of men are bending of
<pb facs="tcp:33830:14"/>their tongues like bows, for lyes and falſhood; there ſhould be found amongſt us, ſome who are valiant for the truths of the Goſpel. And when a many among us (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be leaders) are found to be but blind guides; we ſhould yet have ſome ſeers, who in all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs can ſay as he, Acts <hi>20.27. That they have not ſhunned to declare unto us, all the Councel of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whilſt others are daubing with untempered morter, ſowing of pillows under their elbows, and healing the hurt of the Daughter of my people ſlightly, crying peace when there is no peace: yet we have ſome, who are found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Moniters, as to our approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imminent dangers, by whom
<pb facs="tcp:33830:15"/>(inſtrumentally) the ſilver Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of the Goſpel, giveth forth a moſt certain ſound; cauſing the Saints and people of God, to ſee and underſtand, that now it is high time to prepare to the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
            <p>Amongſt whom, this worthy and faithful ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, the Author of theſe excellent enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſes, diſervedly ought to be reckoned, and rancked, not in the meaneſt place; whoſe deſign herein, (next unto the glory of God) I doubt not confidently to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, is the ſpiritual good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all his people; whileſt it evidently appeareth, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth the good of all, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the houſhold of faith: of ſome he hath compaſſion, making a
<pb facs="tcp:33830:15"/>difference; others he ſaveth with fear, pulling them out of the fire; that if poſſible he might preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>To this end our Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, in delivering the mind of God in this Diſcourſe, ſo ſpeaketh, as ſtooping down to the meaneſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; ſo manifeſting much of a ſweet Self-denying and Soul-ſaving Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whoſe Preaching is not with inticeing words of mens wiſdom, but in the demonſtration of the Spirit, and with Power; who though he could ſpeak with Tongues, (God having given him the Tongue of the Learned, that he might know how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to every weary ſoul) yet I am ſure, that in the Church of Chriſt, he had rather ſpeak five
<pb facs="tcp:33830:16"/>words with his underſtanding, that all might he edified and comforted, than five hundred in an unknown Tongue.</p>
            <p>But I need not ſay any more in this matter; the Work that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, Chriſtian Reader, doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſpeak for him; wherein he, as a good Steward of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Grace of God, doth labour to give to every one a portion: for here thou haſt both milk for Babes, and ſtrong meat for ſtrong Men in Chriſt. Such as are yet ſtrangers to Chriſt, he labours to bring them into a meaſure of Spiritual Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him; and ſuch as do in meaſure ſavingly know him, he labours to put them into a more full enjoyment of him.</p>
            <p>In order hereunto, in the firſt
<pb facs="tcp:33830:16"/>place, he wiſely and faithfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints all who deſire to ſet their faces <hi>Zion</hi>-ward, what things they may meet withal in travelling thither; letting them underſtand the worſt firſt, that meeting with ſuch things in the way, they might not be diſcouraged, ſo as to be turned out of the good way of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in thoſe ſweet Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, he (as a Son of Conſolation) doth ſpeak comfortably, labouring more and more to confirm and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage all the godly to keep on in their way; conſidering, that all who are now in Heaven (that Haven of Reſt and Happineſs) have more or leſs trod in the ſame path, <hi>viz.</hi> of Active and Paſſive Obedience.</p>
            <p>Yea, our Lord himſelf, who is
<pb facs="tcp:33830:17"/>the Captain of our Salvation, in his bringing of many Sons to Glory was made perfect through Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and is through Sufferings entered into Glory. In which way, all that will be found good Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt, muſt be willing to follow him.</p>
            <p>Now as a ſtrong enducement, or as a mighty encouraging and perſwaſive argument hereunto, our reverend Author doth hold out in theſe divine diſcourſes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſweet promiſes, as being proper and peculiar to all, and only to ſuch as ſhall be found overcomers; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intimating unto us, firſt, That here while we are in the body, is the time and place, for managing of this ſpiritual combat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict; and then ſecondly, here is laid
<pb facs="tcp:33830:17"/>before us, what theſe Enemies are with which we are to encounter in this ſpiritual combat; namely, Sin and Satan, the World and the Fleſh. Thirdly, by what means e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian, ſhall be enabled ſo to manage the great engagement, as they may undoubtedly be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querers in the end; I more then Conquerers, <hi>viz.</hi> Through the faith of Chriſt; who loveth all that are his; which love of his being ſhed abroad in a ſoul; will be in it ſuch conſtraining love, as will be ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than death; cauſing the ſoul ſo to exerciſe faith in Chriſt, that through the ſtrengh of Chriſt it ſhall certainly prevail, and wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; and ſo come in the end to ſee and ſhare in the comfort of thoſe ſweet promiſes; <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>THE order of giving this Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is very obſervable; For God the Father gave it to his Son Jeſus Chriſt; Chriſt to his Angel, the Angel to <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to the Seven Churches in <hi>Aſia. Rev.</hi> 1.1, 4. It's obſerved, that this <hi>John</hi> was honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be an Evangeliſt in his Goſpel; an Apoſtle in his Epiſtles: and a Prophet in his <hi>Revelation.</hi> It is a Book of ſingular uſe to Chriſtians to the end of the world: And though many things in it are very
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33830:19"/>myſterious, which Chriſt will reveal to his Servants in their proper ſeaſons, yet many things are more clear and obvious. The Epiſtles to the Churches, though directed to the Angel of each Church, yet concern the whole body, and each member; and therefore it's ſaid, <hi>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the ſpirit ſpeaks unto the Churches:</hi> This is ſpoken to each particular Church, which plainly ſhews they were all bound to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the voice of the Holy Ghoſt in all that is delivered; yea, all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that have been ſince, now are, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall be, are concerned in it; for all that is written, is for our learning, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom the ends of the world are come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. The Text is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of that Epiſtle directed to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus:</hi> By the Angel, ſome underſtand the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſo ſtiled to ſhew both their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and duty. This <hi>Epheſus</hi> was that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. where the great goddeſs. <hi>Diana</hi> was ſo much eſteemed, in which a Church was planted, at firſt vigorous and flouriſhing; but at this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33830:19"/>time declining, both in her inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and outward converſation: cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">

Now the words of the Text are a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous and ſweet promiſe given out to encourage her to repentance and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of her ſelf: Having uſed threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning arguments, he concludes with this excellent and full promiſe, if by any means ſhe might be brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member whence ſhe was fallen, and might get Victory over her preſent dangerous Diſtempers: <hi>To him that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh, I will give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God.</hi> Here is

            <p>Doct. <hi>That Overcomers ſhall eat of the Tree of Life in Gods Paradiſe.</hi> Here is ſomething implied, and alſo ſomething expreſſed, of theſe in order.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33830:20"/>
            <p n="1">1 That which is implied is, that we have Enemies who fight againſt us, and ſeek our deſtruction for ever, againſt whom we are to manage a Spiritual Warfare; and though none under twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years old in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> went forth to War, yet here none are exempted: not only are Miniſters called to act and quit themſelves as good Soldiers of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. as <hi>Timothy</hi> was, the Weapons of whoſe Warfare are not Carnal, but Spiritual, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. They are to fight by the preaching of the Word, weilding well that ſword of the Spirit, by Church cenſures, by enduring hardſhip, and the like; yet is not the War limited to them, but every one muſt come out to the battel, even young ones muſt ſtrive to fight this good fight, wherein the glory of God, and the cauſe of their Souls are eminently concerned. This world is the field in which the Battels are to be fought, and the War managed: In Heaven there are no Enemies, nor ſhall they there learn War any more; 'Tis true, we read there was war in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33830:20"/>
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.7. and the Dragon and his angels fought; but it is meant of the Church here, often called Heaven in Scripture and in this Book of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;</hi> This world is the Enemies Country, and while the Church is here, it muſt be militant, in a conflicting and warring condition, and this without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion; the Enemies are reſtleſs and implacable, and will admit no truce, no ceſſation of arms: In Heaven above they are Triumphant, having Crowns on their Heads, and Palms in their hands in token of full Victory; but here we muſt all hold ſwords, and labour to be expert in war, every one having his ſword upon his thigh, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 8. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of fear in the night; this war is both defenſive and offenſive; we muſt not only be ſtanding upon our guard in our own defence, but God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided armour by which we may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Enemies and worſt them in the Combate: as they ſaid of old, <hi>to your Tents O Iſrael;</hi> ſo let me ſay, to your arms, to your arms, O all ye chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, eſpecially, O all Believers;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33830:21"/>take to you the whole armour of God, whereby ye may be able to withſtand in every evil day, and having done all to ſtand: For this is not an arbitrary buſineſs, but of that abſolute neceſſity, that we muſt either fight or dye, kill or be killed, conquer our Enemies, or be finally and eternally overcome by them: The Trumpet of the Goſpel gives no uncertain ſound, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. but requires us to prepare our ſelves to the Battel. If any ſay, who, or where are our Enemies? I anſwer, the Fleſh, the Devil, and the World, are the profeſſed and avowed Enemies of our Souls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Fleſh; our carnal and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts; theſe are our worſt Enemies; the greateſt fight is within; <hi>quot vitia, tot inimici:</hi> as many Adverſaries as there are corruptions: 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 13, 14. when <hi>Athaliah</hi> heard the noiſe of the Guard and of the People in the Temple, She came into the Temple, and ſeeing them in their Warlike poſture, ſhe rent her Clothes, and cried Treaſon, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: when we look into our hearts, which ſhould be the Temples of God,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33830:21"/>and find ſo many luſts gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there, that are Enemies to Chriſt, and would not he ſhould reign in us, and ſeek to betray our Souls to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without us, we may well cry out Treaſon, Treaſon. Proud luſts, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous luſts, unclean luſts, lying and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, diſtruſt and infidelity, with a great Regiment beſides, theſe war con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually againſt our Souls, and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government of Chriſt and the Dominion of his Spirit and Grace in us; againſt theſe therefore we ſhould bend our main Forces: more eſpecially;
<list>
                  <item>1. Againſt the ſin of our Nature: This is called the Law in our Members, and is ſaid to war againſt the Law of our mind: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. This enemy is ever preſent with us, as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> complained; when we ſhould doe good, it is preſent, either to divert us from it, or diſtract us in it. This is a very importunate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, a wreſtleſs and unwearied Enemy: we may ceaſe evil acts, when we cannot avoid inward motions: this was it which made that excellent Apoſtle cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, Rom.</hi> 7.24.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33830:22"/>
                     <hi>who ſhall deliver me?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The ſpecial, predominant, and moſt beloved <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,</hi> the ſin that doth more eaſily beſet us, we ſhould bend our utmoſt ſtrength againſt this: every one hath a <hi>peccatum in deliciis,</hi> a darling ſin, a right eye of pleaſure, a right hand of profit; and though no true Believer can have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſin, for he hates every falſe way, yet ſome ſin there is by which he is moſt eaſily overcome; and againſt this the heat of the Battel ſhould be directed; As it was ſaid of old <hi>fight neither with ſmall nor great, but with the King of Iſrael</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 33.31.</item>
               </list> So ſay I, fight above all with the Ruling luſt and predominant cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: the ſin that we cannot well hear reproved, can hardly tell how to part with, are moſt delighted and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the thoughts of it, is firſt in a morning and laſt at night with us: Oh this is that Enemy which when it kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, is ready to kill us; we may eaſily ſee the dagger it hath, ready to ſtrike us under the firth rib, even when it fawns and flatters moſt, as <hi>Joab</hi> did to <hi>Abner:</hi> we can never be too careful here, to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33830:22"/>ſtand upon our watch, to keep guard againſt it, as David did; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I was alſo upright before God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and kept my ſelf from mine inquity:</hi> No better means of ſafety, no greater ſign of integrity, then to keep our ſelves from our iniquity: Let our chief war be againſt theſe indwelling Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, eſpecially, againſt the ſin of our Nature, and the evil we are moſt apt to indulge, and are moſt addicted to, and the Victory over the reſt will be rendred much more facile and eaſy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Satan is another of thoſe Enemies to be encountred by us; for the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon and his Angels fight againſt us; they aſſault us with all ſorts of dangerous weapons: we read of the wiles of the Devil; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. the devices or methods of Satan: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. the fiery darts of that wicked one: <hi>Diabolus eſt methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus ad fallendum:</hi> Hence the Apoſtle brings in Satan under the notion of a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, againſt whom we are to combate: and a ſubtil Enemy he is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, for he has bin experienced in warring againſt mens Souls for above 5000 years; He
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33830:23"/>labours ſometimes to beat their Armour out of their hand, eſpecially the ſhield of Faith, and the ſword of the Spirit, becauſe theſe prejudice him moſt. He watches the fitteſt time to aſſault; the policy of Souldiers is ſeen in obſerving the right ſeaſon, ſo doth Satan: he takes the time of Solitarineſs, the time of Sleepineſs, or the time of Wearineſs, and the like. He takes the advantage of place: Souldiers that are to fight, have a ſpecial regard to the ground they are to fight upon, that they may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by get ſome advantage againſt their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, ſo Satan does; he obſerves the ground we ſtand upon: if upon high places, he knows how to lay his ſnares there, and to entice us by the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate love of earthly things, from God and his ways; if upon low places, he has his wiles there, temptations ſuitable to a poor condition: Hence is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of that wiſe man, <hi>Give, me nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Poverty nor Riches; Prov.</hi> 30.8, 9. he was not ignorant of Satans devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In both, in a word, he holds, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with that in party in us, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33830:23"/>he knows is true to him, our ſin and corruption: this is the treacherous party within, which he engageth to betray us into his hand without: which makes our condition dangerous, by giving ſuch advantage to Satan. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out are fightings, and within are fears,</hi> becauſe he hath always a party in our boſomes true to his cauſe: It is this that renders him ſo formidable an Enemy; if all were right within us, he would loſe his deſigns upon us, as he did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt: <hi>The Prince of this World cometh,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and hath nothing in me. Joh.</hi> 14.30. But in Believers he finds an army of doubtings and carnal fears; troops of carnal reaſonings and diſputings, theſe take part with him, and give him often to overcome them; others he takes captive at his will; but even good men by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving place to him, and by being betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their corruptions, are worſted by him. How greatly then doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them and all others to reſiſt this adverſary at the firſt, and not give way to him? <hi>Turpius ejicitur, quam non ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittitur hoſtis:</hi> He is more eaſily kept
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33830:24"/>out at firſt, than caſt out afterwards. Add to all this, He is an active and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enemy; called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the wicked one; becauſe he is always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to circumvent, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſtroy Souls. He is a potent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; though he hath loſt all his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet not his ſtrength; they are principalities and power ſtill. He is a preſent enemy, can be always at our right hand whereever we are; no place can be a ſanctuary to us from his aſſaults: Some think by ſhutting themſelves up in a cloiſter, they can ſhut out Satan, and that he dares not come where they ſprinkle holy-water; but he can be with us in any place, and let us be never ſo ſecret and cloſe, we cannot exclude two from being preſent with us, <hi>viz.</hi> God and Satan. He is a cruel enemy, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe who yield to him; the natural Lion, they ſay, ſpares him that ſubmits to him; hence that, <hi>Satis eſt proſtraſſe Leoni:</hi> But this mercileſs Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, roars moſt terribly upon, and carries it moſt cruelly to thoſe who yield. In a word, he is a conſtant adverſary; 'Tis
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33830:24"/>ſaid, <hi>Saul</hi> became <hi>Davids</hi> enemy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.29. This is true here, Satan is an implacable, perpetual enemy, and therefore we muſt fight, <hi>per aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum mortem,</hi> by open defiance of him and all his attempts; and though we war, <hi>impari proelio,</hi> he being upon the upper ground, the Prince of the Air, ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places, ſo that we are like little <hi>David</hi> to great <hi>Goliah;</hi> yet if we act our parts well, though we be too weak, yet we have a good ſecond, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19. God hath laid help upon one that is mighty; of which more afterward.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The World is another enemy we are to combat and grapple with; we read much of overcoming the world in the Epiſtle of St. <hi>John,</hi> not by carnal wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, for Chriſt bid <hi>Peter</hi> put up his Sword when he would be fighting; but with ſpiritual Armor. What is the evil, may ſome ſay, that is in the world to be overcome? I would ſay thus, Take the creatures as they come out of Gods hand, ſo they are good, and make no war againſt us, nor are we called to put
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33830:25"/>forth any acts of hoſtility againſt them; but as our other enemies, Sin and Satan, make them inſtruments to ourhurt, and cauſe us to miſimploy them. <hi>Every creature of God it good,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>if ſanctified by the Word and Prayer;</hi> but by the ſinful abuſe of them, turn to evil, and help on the ruine of men. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is apt to become a trap and a ſnare to defile and deſtroy us; upon which account alone we are called forth to fight againſt them. To inſtance, In our attaining great things in the world, it is our enemy: They that will be rich, <hi>per fas, &amp; nefas,</hi> right or wrong, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. ſlighty in the great matters of their Souls and Eternity, but eager in coveting and purſuing earthly things; theſe fall into a ſhare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition; <hi>For the love of money is the root of all evil, and they who are violent in the purſuit of it, have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Judas,</hi> and many Thouſands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides have found the truth of theſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33830:25"/>things; <hi>Soenior armis incumbet luxuria,</hi> Juv. So in our retaining the world, there is a dangerous ſnare, as well as in attaining of them: The hold-faſt; men have of theſe things, is like a mans holding red-hot Iron, or a Firebrand, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which he has need of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative. This was the young mans utter ruine, of whom the Goſpel makes mention. <hi>There is that ſcattereth, and yet encreaſeth; and there is that with-holdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſays <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 11.24. Further, In the very enjoying of the world, there is an evil to be fought againſt, which is, that it ſtick not too near our heart: <hi>Wiſdom is good with an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.11. Godly wiſdom: though wiſdom without an inheritance is apt to be deſpiſed: no man remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that wiſe man who delivered the City, becauſe he was a poor man, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.15. yet an inheritance without wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is not good to the owner of it, but a temptation, fuel of luſt, pride, vanity, and ſo is harmful for want of this wiſdom to order and keep it in its
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33830:26"/>right place, out of the heart. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there is hoſtility to be uſed againſt the world, even in our paſſing through the world; leſt it cauſe us to loſe our ſight of God, by interpoſing between him and us. A man may hide the Sun from his eye with his hand. A little of the world, if we be not careful, may be like a cloud, which will keep us from the ſight of God: But to be curnbred with a multiplicity of cares about theſe things, is to ſet great mountains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and us, to cauſe an eclipſe of his countenance, that we cannot behold him: The Moon eclipſeth the Sun from our ſight; earthly things hide the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſace of God from us, if we be not very watchful againſt them. Yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we are to fight againſt this ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as it doth oppoſe grace, and hinder us in our faith, hope, and charity. In our Faith; he that ſees a fair eſtate, had need pray and ſay, Lord, draw the curtain, and let me by faith ſee thee and thy beauty and glory: The God of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. (or God in his glory) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and this ſo dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33830:26"/>the glory of this world, that by Faith he left all at the call of God: So much as we fix our eye upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo much the leſs we ſee of God; and ſo much the more our faith is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. When <hi>Jacob</hi> had leaſt of this world, he ſaw moſt of God; and ſo it is with many: So for hope, the world of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hurts that: the ſoul is ready to ſay, How ſhall I travel over the fords and deeps of the world? how ſhall I be able to reſign up my all? This is hard and difficult, to ſell all, to part with all; the hope of better things will carry us through it, but if we fix here, hope is loſt: ſo love and charity, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed; there is ſpiritual whoredom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul and the Creature, by the love of the world; <hi>Ye adulterers and adultereſſes,</hi> ſays St. <hi>James, Jam.</hi> 4.4. know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God?</hi> Some take it for that ſpiritual adultrey, wherein a man gives his love away from God to the Creature: where love to the world prevails, the beſt things are ſlighted and undervalued; we ought to hate Father
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33830:27"/>and Mother, Brother and Siſter, Houſes and Lands, yea, and our own Life alſo, for Chriſt's ſake, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. when they ſtand between us and God, then away with them; had we not need watch and war againſt the world, to ſubdue it and get the upper hand of it? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. <hi>All things are lawful, but I will not he brought under the power of any,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> He would ſtand upon the liberty and priviledg Chriſt gave him, he would have the upper hand of theſe things, nothing ſhould command his love, his fear, or his joy: and it is ſweet walking with God, when in this frame of Spirit. That man who ſtands in right terms with the things of the world, is content in every condition, inſtructed in all things, and can be in want or abound, as it pleaſeth God to order for him; and this we ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count better then the greateſt eſtate in the Countrey: theſe will come on faſter in all grace, that can caſt off this weight, and will run the race ſet before them, and none ſhall hinder them: this is the generation of Travellers: when <hi>Jacob</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:33830:27"/>went from his Fathers Houſe, he had but a ſtaff, and a ſtone; a ſtaff to walk with in the day, and a ſtone to reſt his head upon in the night; yet he returned two bands, and glorious viſions of God were given him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. though he met with hardſhip, yet theſe made him pluck up his feet, and go on chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. This will put reſolution into the heart of a Chriſtian, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.23, 24. <hi>None of theſe things move me,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, neither do I count my life dear, ſo I may finiſh my courſe with joy.</hi> This is that which is implied, That we have Enemies to war and combate with, and we hear what they are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which is expreſſed is, that Overcomers; all that get Victory of theſe Enemies, ſhall eat of the Tree of Life in God's Paradiſe. Some, Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons follow for a brief explication of this propoſition.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Who may be ſaid to be Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Apoſtle doth beſt of all reſolve the Queſtion: which he firſt propounds, and then anſwers. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.5.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33830:28"/>
               <hi>Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God?</hi> Though the world is only named, yet all the Enemies are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for he that gets victory over one, overcomes them all: ſome will ſay, who doth not believe this, that Jeſus is the Son of God? There will ſoon be an end of the war, if this be all, the Victory will be eaſy: let ſuch know, that though there be no great difficulty in giving our aſſent to this propoſition, yet the Deity of Chriſt hath been denied and oppoſed by none of the meaneſt for learning; not onely by the Phariſees whilſt he himſelf lived, but in the times when this Apoſtle wrote his Epiſtle; and afterwards by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> of late. How few imbrace it with a Divine Faith, which is the only Faith that overcomes in the day of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al? Some take this up upon reaſons of antiquity, Authority and Conſent of the Church in which they live, but this Faith will not give us Victory; if great trials ariſe upon this Fundamental Article in the Creed: when the Apoſtle
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33830:28"/>wrote this, it was the critical point, the <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> as I may ſay, by which one was diſtinguiſhed from another; the diſcriminating Doctrine; the word of Chriſt's patience. Perſecution roſe ſo high upon the defenders of this great truth, as their Liberties and Lives were in danger to be taken from them for maintaining it; at ſuch a day not to be afraid to confeſs Chriſt to be the Eternal Son of God, gave a comfortable ground to conclude them true Believers; ſuch Faith might charitably be judged right, by which they thus overcame the world. 'Tis an eaſy thing when a Proteſtant Prince reigns, to declare we believe that Tranſubſtantiation is an error, contrary to Scripture, reaſon, and our very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but if Popery ſhould come in like a flood, and be the prevailing Intereſt, and condemn them to be burnt for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks who deny it, as was the caſe of the Martyrs in the Marian days; then to be ſtedfaſt even to the death in this perſwaſion, would be a very hopeful evidence of the truth of our belief, and of our Victory over the World. So in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33830:29"/>the caſe this Text mentions; O how few would find Faith and Patience, to help them to ſeal to this, That Chriſt is the Son of God, Coeſſential and Coeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal with the Father, with their blood! How few would dare to appear to own it, as it is ſaid, <hi>Athinaſius</hi> did, when the World was in a manner, over-run with Arianiſm? When <hi>St. Peter</hi> had maid that excellent confeſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16, 17. <hi>Thou art Chriſt, the Son of the living God,</hi> what ſays Chriſt to this? <hi>Bleſſed art thou Simon, &amp;c.</hi> and though he was afterwards foiled, yet he overcame all in the end. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What is that Paradiſe of God promiſed here to Overcomers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Heaven, even the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the true Celeſtial Paradiſe. For what in one verſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2, 4. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles <hi>the third Heaven,</hi> in another, he calls it <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> And thus to be taken in the Text and Doctrine now before us. Here ſeems to be an alluſion to the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> where God diſpoſed of <hi>Adam</hi> after he had created him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.10. ſtiled <hi>the Garden of God;</hi> which was a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33830:29"/>large circuit of ground, richly furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all good things, as became ſo excellent a Workman; and was every way anſwerable to the ends for which it was prepared, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12. Some judge it was a type of the Church, which is called a Garden encloſed, and a Figure of Heaven: It was doubtleſs the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt ſpot of ground in the World; there were all ſort of pleaſant Trees, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Fruits; and free liberty to eat of them all, one onely excepted. Who can declare the delights of the Celeſtial Paradiſe? <hi>Eden</hi> had a very famous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that ran through it, and watered it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.4. So there is a River in Heaven, far excelling that, the Streams whereof make glad that City of God: It doth overflow to refreſh the Church here, but runs with a full current there, and raviſh the Inhabitants of that Paradiſe with unexpreſſible pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. In <hi>Eden</hi> of old, the Covenant between God and <hi>Adam</hi> was perfect, till man brake it: In Heaven, the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and all the myſteries of Grace therein are accompliſhed. <hi>Adam</hi> was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:33830:30"/>without ſin and ſorrow, and might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have ſo kept himſelf, when he was in <hi>Eden:</hi> But there is no poſſibility of ſin or trouble in the heavenly Paradiſe. In the Garden of <hi>Eden, Adam</hi> had free acceſs to, and fellowſhip with his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; but in Heaven they have it with God as a Father, and more fully and durably then <hi>Adam</hi> had; by which we may ſee the Paradiſe, what it is.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Who and what is the Tree of Life mentioned in the Text?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt himſelf, and he onely, is the true Tree of Life. <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.18. So ſtiled by <hi>Solomon,</hi> under the name of <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> thus he ſpeaks of Chriſt; <hi>She is a Tree of Life to them that lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her;</hi> an alluſion to that Tree of Life which was in the Garden of <hi>Eden;</hi> which is made by ſome a Sacrament, and Seal of that Covenant, by which God aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Adam</hi> the continuance of his natural Life during his abode on Earth; and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life when he ſhould be removed from hence, in caſe he kept this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. They who lay hold on Chriſt by true Faith, have the beſt Seal that can
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33830:30"/>be of Spiritual and Eternal Life; 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath Life;</hi> the Fountain of Life, the Bread of Life, the Water of Life, the Well of Life, the Tree of Life. That Tree in <hi>Eden</hi> was, as ſome judge, both <hi>alimentum</hi> and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamentum;</hi> food and phyſick; ſo is Chriſt: he is the Tree of Life that is ſaid to bear twelve manner of Fruits e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very month, and whoſe Leaves are for the healing of the nations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.2. That Tree of Life in <hi>Eden,</hi> ſtood in the midſt of the Garden, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9. that it might be often in the view of our firſt Parents, which way ſoever they went, either to their Food or to their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Chriſt is in the midſt of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of God, and will be in the view of all Believers for ever. Thoſe Trees of Righteouſneſs will be round about him to all Eternity. But you will ſay,</p>
            <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>What is it to eat of this Tree of Life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To eat, is to preſs forth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ſweetneſs that is in our Food, that we may partake of the benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Overcomers ſhall participate of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33830:31"/>fulneſs of Chriſt to their own joy. In eating there is a natural delight ariſing from the taſte of our meat: 'tis ſaid, <hi>They did eat, Neh.</hi> 9.15. <hi>and delighted themſelves in thy great goodneſs:</hi> ſo of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they did eat and were all filled: 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. <hi>Elijah</hi> did eat and was ſtrengthened: of another 'tis ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. he did eat, and his Spirit came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and he revived. They that get Victory over their Spiritual Enemies, ſhall feed and feaſt themſelves upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the true Tree of Life in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whereby all their deſires ſhall be ſatisfied, and their Appetites quenched, and they everlaſtingly ſtrengthened, to behold his glory, and to follow him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he goeth.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>Why does the promiſe run in theſe terms, That he will make them eat of the tree of life in the midſt of the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Partly to mind us of that firſt ſin by which we were overcome in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> as he was the publick head and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of all mankind, that we may be humbled for it; and partly to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33830:31"/>ſhew us that this happineſs then loſt, is recoverable by Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſhall be the portion of them that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome: Not that they ſhall return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> as ſome have concluded from this Text; but a far more excellent eſtate and felicity than we ſhould have had, if <hi>Adam</hi> had never fallen: which cauſed ſome to cry out, O <hi>felix peccatum!</hi> O happy ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which has occaſioned the bringing in of a far better estate!

               <hi>France</hi> is reported to ſay, <hi>He would not change his part in</hi> Paris <hi>for a part in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi> Such a one was the young man in the Goſpel, who would not quit his earthly treaſures for heavenly, and theſe aſſured by Chriſt himſelf. Worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents are their chief joy, though but a Fools paradiſe. <hi>Thou fool,</hi> ſays Chriſt to him that bid his ſoul take its eaſe, for he had goods for many years, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. <hi>Solomon</hi> among other vanities, planted Orchards and Gardens with variety of Trees, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. but not a Tree of Life amongſt them all. Oh! that men could believe how ſad their end will be, who have no better things than theſe, who get no ſpiritual conqueſts over the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of their Souls; their end will be eternal expulſion and excluſion from the Paradiſe of God. As God ſent forth, and drove out <hi>Adam</hi> from the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> (whether by his word of command, or by forcible ſtrength, is not material) never to return thither again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.23, 24. ſo will he drive away all the wicked like chaff, and ſcatter them like ſmoke, that they never enter in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial

He that is thrown down by his enemy, and lies ſtill in and under his fall, not ſtriving to riſe and recover himſelf, this man is fully overcome; but thus it is not with any true believer: Let none ſuch be diſcouraged, though never ſo weak, but remember that of <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.11. <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong;</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe and ye ſhall ſee the Glory of

There are many things to encourage Chriſtians to look about them, and quit themſelves like men, and be ſtrong: as,
<list>
                  <item>1. The paucity of thoſe who conquer; <hi>To him that overcometh,</hi> ſays the Text: Not to them, but to him, to note they are but few. Chriſt propheſied that many will be offended, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.9, 10. <hi>The love of many ſhall wax cold,</hi> and it is but a He that endureth to the end. Oh how great a mercy will it he to be found in that remnant. <hi>David</hi> had many Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, few Worthies; many make a

                  <item>2. There are ſome advantages Believers have, which if well improved may give them the upper hand of their Enemies;
<list>
                        <item>1. They have the armour of God; that belongs to every Chriſtian: when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was to fight againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.38, 39. he was preſented with the beſt Armour, even by the King himſelf, which was no ſmall encouragement. Believers are preſented with a whole coat of excellent Armour, every piece of it is Armour of proof, and this by the King of Kings: <hi>Saul</hi>'s Armour was too heavy for <hi>David,</hi> he attempted to go in it, but could not: God hath made every piece of the Spiritual Armour fit and ſuitable to every true Believer.</item>
                        <item>2. They have Chriſt for their Standard-bearer, whoſe heart fainted not, nor melted away, as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Eſay</hi> 10.18. The Standard-bearer fainteth; when he ſees the Army rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he caſts away his Colours and flecth; ſo did not Chriſt; hence that of St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid I ſhould glory in any
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:33830:36"/>thing ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> viz. in the death and ſufferings of Chriſt; I will not leave my Colours, I find the world, and my worldly affections dead, and doubt not but to have compleat Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in due time.</item>
                        <item>3. They have the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Angels, and the ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of God with them.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list> All things come alike to all in the Court of Nature, but things come in ſpecial to ſome in the Court of Grace: they have more for them than againſt them, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.16.17. which if their eyes were open they might ſee: And if God be for them, who can be againſt them? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31. The ſucceſs muſt needs be on their ſide, becauſe having ſuch a conduct, they can march on, preventing and avoiding the ſtratagems of the Enemy: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> took it for a ſingular privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.26, 27. that he could ſo run and ſo fight as to obtain, and keep under his Enemy, and not be a caſt-away; yea, by this they do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpy out the drift of the Enemy, but can fetch in Recruit and freſh Auxiliaries in time of need, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. When their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33830:37"/>own ſtrength fails, God gives in aſſiſting Grace, freſh anointings, ſurmounting the Grace they had before, as he ſees the matter requireth: <hi>David</hi> could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage himſelf in the Lord his God: hence could ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.1. <hi>I will love thee, O Lord my ſtrength;</hi> and he had good reaſon, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6, 7. for when the <hi>Amalekites</hi> had carried away all, God ſtrengthened him to purſue after them, and to recover all again. Yea, more, they have the advantage of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing things patiently and quietly; when the Lord makes them poor, they make many rich; when corrected, yet not killed, always bearing about them the dying of the Lord Jeſus: Sick and yet quiet, poor and yet quiet, proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and buffetted, yet quiet: In a word, they have that intereſt above, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from above, that they can ſet themſelves againſt the world, and do more by Faith and Prayer, than others can do by Wit and Policy; for they can lead captivity captive, and by their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtrength tread down ſtrength: I mean in a ſpiritual ſenſe; for Chriſtians
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:33830:37"/>ſhould be peaceable ſubjects to their King, and peaceable neighbours with their neighbours; but to war againſt ſpiritual Enemies, here they can ſay, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Thanks be to God who giveth us the Victory. I have fought with beaſts at Epheſus,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul;</hi> a great Victory, whether you underſtand it as ſome do, of ſavage beaſtly men, or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, as others; they ſay he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the ſentence of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, to be committed to the wild Beaſts to be devoured by them, unleſs he were able to reſcue himſelf, which he did; he lived and acted by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved him; and gave himſelf for him, ſo that he had Victory over the World, and could ſay, O my worldly Enemies, where is your Venom, your Gall? where is now your Enmity, your Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory? To conclude, Believers have many excellent promiſes to encourage them to fight and overcome: Seven in this and the next Chapter, of which the Text is the firſt: O let us fear leſt we ſhould ſo much as ſeem to fall ſhort
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33830:38"/>of them: <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. meditate much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this in the Text; 'Tis ſweet in the very reading of it: How pleaſant will it then be in its accompliſhment? I end with that Parallel Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the Gates into the City.</hi>

            <p>THESE words are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Epiſtle to the Church in <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and ſo the eighth verſe of this Chapter ſheweth, <hi>To the angel of the Church in Smyrna, write,</hi> &amp;c. Some ſay this Church was more faulty then the former; but Chriſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and conceals them, leſt the ſight of her former ſins, and the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her future ſufferings, both at once, ſhould too much diſcourage her: Others think that ſhe was, though the pooreſt, yet the pureſt of all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33830:39"/>
               <hi>I know thy poverty,</hi> ſays Chriſt to her, <hi>but thou art rich,</hi> verſe 9. poor in temporals, but rich in ſpiritual; outward poverty joyned with inward purity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends none to Chriſt. Her name was anſwerable to her nature, I mean, her new nature. <hi>Smyrna</hi> ſignifies a ſweet ſmell, and her Graces were like beaten Spices, very fragrant and odoriferous, they caſt a ſweet ſavour even through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Churches. It ſeems a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtorm of perſecution was ready to come down upon them, wherein ſome of them might be called to reſiſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bonds only and impriſonment, but even unto blood and Martyrdom; for he tells them, <hi>The Devil,</hi> (that is, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men who are the Devils Bayliffs and Agents) <hi>ſhall caſt ſome of them into Priſon;</hi> and then bids them <hi>be faithful unto death,</hi> verſe. 10. which implies that it might reach even to life it ſelf. To encourage them to faithfulneſs in all, he gives this ſweet promiſe in the Text, as if he had ſaid, get Victory here; and if it comes to the worſt men can do, which is to kill the body, I give you my faithful

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Death ſometimes ſignifies great afflictions and diſtreſſes: <hi>Intreat the Lord
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33830:40"/>your God,</hi> ſays <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, that he may take away from me this death only,</hi> Exod. 10.17. that is, the judgment of the Locuſts then upon him; for being ſuch Locuſts as never was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor ſhould be after, they might be a deadly annoyance to them, as well as devour the fruits of the Earth. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of Gods delivering him from a great death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an imminent danger, which he calls a death, becauſe it was paſt means, help, and hope of delivery. Such deaths he was in often, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. which were either ſuch ſickneſſes and perſecutions in which there appeared no hope of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping with life, or ſuch pains as were equivalent to the pangs of death. But more particularly:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Death is taken for the diſſolution of nature, <hi>diſſolutio compoſiti:</hi> ſo ſome define it, the diſſolving the earthly houſe of this Tabernacle, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. A Tent or Tabernacle is deſtroyed, not by conſuming of the parts, but by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them aſunder: the death of the body is no annihilation, but a diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33830:40"/>of the parts of which man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, a cutting a-ſunder the ſoul and the body: This is the firſt death, which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> deſired, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.23. The ſoul ſleeps not when a man dies, for then his wiſh had been vain; upon his diſſolution he could not have been with Chriſt; but the union between the body and ſoul is cut a-ſunder, and the ſoul which wilſt in the body was abſent from the Lord, is then abſent from the body, and preſent with the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. This is that death all muſt paſs under, or ſomething equivalent to it; <hi>It is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all men once to dye,</hi> Heb. 9.27. <hi>Statutum eſt,</hi> It is enacted in the Court of Heaven by a Statute-Law, more ſure than the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which cannot be altered: A ſentence gone forth out of the mouth of God concerning all men, never to be rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: <hi>Death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Death is taken for Hell and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; even the wrath of God inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them that are finally overcome
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:33830:41"/>by the enemies of their Souls. <hi>Death and hell were caſt into the lake of fire; this is the ſecond death,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 20.14. Men dead and buried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were now ſent body and ſoul to Hell, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8.</p>
            <p>Qu. 2. <hi>Wherein lies the great evil and hurt of the ſecond death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is altogether unexpreſſible and inconceivable: <hi>Who knows the power of thine anger,</hi> ſays <hi>David? Pſal.</hi> 90.11. Let none be offended or affrighted at the opening of it; A Sermon of Hell, if rightly emproved, may keep us from Hell. The hurt and evil of the ſecond death lies in Two things:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. There is, <hi>paena damni,</hi> the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of loſs; This is great and grievous, for they who fall under it, loſe all good at once; they loſe Heaven that holy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, that, <hi>ſedes beatorum,</hi> the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and dwelling-place of all that are bleſſed. When <hi>Tully</hi> was baniſhed from <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> from <hi>Athens,</hi> they were ſo troubled, that as oft as they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards thoſe places they wept. What is <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> and a thouſand ſuch
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:33830:41"/>places more, if compared with Heaven? Though here unſound Profeſſors may have room in Gods ſanctuary, yet there will be no place for them in his Palace hereafter: To be excluded hence, will trouble and perplex them. They loſe the beſt dainties, there ſeems to be eating and drinking in Heaven; Chriſt will gird himſelf, and make his Servants ſit down to meat, and will come forth and ſerve them, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.37. They ſhall have flagons of Wine to comfort them, and Chriſt will ſay to them, eat O Friends, and drink abundantly, O beloved. I take it ſpiritually in a far better way than can be here. O the miſery of them that ſhall never taſte of the Supper of the Lamb, of theſe refreſhments in Heaven! Poor men grieve when they are ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way empty from a rich mans Table, much more ſorrowful will they be who ſhall never eat of Chriſt's dainties. In this alſo they loſe the beſt inheritance: <hi>Ahab</hi> was ſick with grief when he could not enjoy <hi>Naboths</hi> inheritance, as we read, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. It will make them head-ſick and heart-ſick alſo, who ſhall
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33830:42"/>be deprived of that incorruptible, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and never-fading inheritance reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Heaven for Overcomers; for the Promiſe is, <hi>He that overcometh ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit all things, Rev.</hi> 21.7. Yea, they loſe the beſt company; the ſociety of Angels and Saints: Here they deſpiſe their company, then they would be glad of it, but ſhall not have it. How deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous was the rich man that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be ſent to him? <hi>Luke</hi> 16. On Earth he deſpiſed him, and in Hell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his company, but it could not be granted him; a great gulph being fixed between them, which would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it: And which is yet worſe, they loſe the company of God and Chriſt. When <hi>Orpah</hi> was to part with <hi>Naomi</hi> her Mother-in-Law, ſhe lifted up her voice and wept, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.14. O how will they who ſhall be ſeparated from God, drench and even drown themſelves in tears! His gracious preſence is the chief good of his creatures; yet this is the firſt word of that dreadful ſentence Chriſt at laſt pronounceth, <hi>Depart from me,</hi> Mat. 25.41. To go from him who hath the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33830:42"/>words of Eternal Life, is the moſt bitter part of the ſecond Death. If <hi>Cain,</hi> when baniſhed from the Society of Saints where God was worſhipped, cried out, <hi>My puniſhment is greater than I can bear, for from thy face ſhall I be hid;</hi> ſurely then to loſe the glorious preſence of God, of the only true God, is more than to loſe a thouſand worlds, if there were ſo many. We read that <hi>Abſolom</hi> could take no Comfort in all he enjoyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not ſee the King's face, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. <hi>Laban</hi> made great ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his fooliſh Idols, when they were ſtollen from him; <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.33. And <hi>Micah</hi> lamented for the loſs of his falſe gods; <hi>Ye have taken away my gods which I made; and what have I more? And yet you ask me, what aileth thee?</hi> Judg. 18.24. How ſad and fearful will the loſs of the King of Kings, of the only true and living God be? Here men can live cheerfully, if they have outward good things, though ſtrangers to the Life of God; yet when they come to ſee what they have loſt, they will find it the moſt bitter ingredient in their cup of miſery.</item>

               <item>2 There is <hi>paena ſenſus,</hi> the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſenſe; for having loſt the chief good, an inundation of all miſchiefs and miſeries will neceſſarily follow, and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably fall upon them: particularly,</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Shame and confuſion of face will cover them: They will riſe to ſhame and contempt. Here men ſin and have a whores forehead, they cannot bluſh; <hi>The unjuſt knoweth no ſhame,</hi> Zephan. 3.5. but then the ſhame of their nakedneſs will appear before all the World. The thief is aſhamed when he is found, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.26. Eſpecially, if he be taken in his wickedneſs before judges and great ones; Oh! how confounded and abaſhed will ſinners be, when all the ſecret evils of their Heart and Life ſhall be laid open and diſcovered before Chriſt, his Angels and Saints: Whither will they cauſe their ſhame to go? Here they glory in ſin which is their ſhame, but then they will be aſhamed of this their glorying, and would be glad if the Hills would hide them, and the Mountains cover them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sorrow and Mourning will fill them: <hi>There,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, <hi>ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33830:43"/>and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> Mat. 8.12. Where? you will ſay, even in Hell: We read of <hi>Rachel</hi> mourning <hi>for her children, and would not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,</hi> Jer. 31.15. Of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s great ſorrow for the ſuppoſed loſs of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 37. <hi>I will go down to the grave to my Son mourning;</hi> thus his father wept for him. Of the great mourning of <hi>Hadramimmon,</hi> in the Valley of <hi>Megiddon,</hi> where <hi>Joſiah</hi> was ſlain, <hi>and all</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for him,</hi> 2 King. 23. But what are all theſe to the hideous cries and ſhrieks, yellings and roarings of them that lye under the wrath of God? 'Tis ſaid, <hi>God will caſt upon them the fury of his wrath, and not ſpare,</hi> Job 20.23. and 27.22.</p>
            <p>No man values a blow, if a Child ſtrike; but if a man, a giant ſtrikes, it is not eaſily born; if an Angel ſmites, it is yet more grievous: but if God caſt upon him his wrath immediately, it goes to the bottom, it pierces deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very Soul; It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, and to have the living God fall upon us:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:33830:44"/>Can our heart endure, or our hands be made ſtrong in the day that he ſhall deal with us? His frowns are able to ſink us; What unſpeakable Sorrow will his blows caſt upon us, fill us with? we know not how to bear his hand upon us here, if it be in extremity, though but upon one part, What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſorrow then will it cauſe to have him caſt his fury upon the whole man, upon all the Members of the Body, and all the faculties of the Soul at once, and not ſpare? A drop of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon <hi>Heman,</hi> upon <hi>David,</hi> made them cry out bitterly; what will a Sea, an Ocean of wrath then do? O the floods and ſeas of Tears that miſerable creatures will then pour forth!</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Curſe of God ſhall reſt upon them: So it follows in that direful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, Mat. 25.41. <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed:</hi> If they might go from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with Bleſſing, it would be ſome comfort; but to depart from him with a Curſe, how very dreadful are the thoughts of it? Yet thus it will be: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies, <hi>The curſe cauſeleſs ſhall not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:33830:44"/>come,</hi> Prov. 26.2. When <hi>Balaam</hi> would have curſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it came not, but was by God turned into a bleſſing; becauſe <hi>Balaam</hi> attempted this without juſt cauſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.22, 23. God requited <hi>David</hi> good for <hi>Shimei</hi>'s curſing him; but God never curſeth without a cauſe, and it is therefore effectual, and ſad are the effects thereof. When <hi>Adam</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſaies God, <hi>Curſed is the ground for thy ſake;</hi> Gen. 3. The whole Creation groans under that curſe unto this day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22. The Diſciples marvelled at the ſudden withering of the Figtree Chriſt curſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.19.20. When <hi>Eliſha</hi> curſed the mocking Children in the Name of the Lord, there came two Bears and tore two and forty of them, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.24. Oh how inſupportable will the Curſe of the infinite God be, that ſhall lie upon them in Hell!</p>
            <p n="4">4. Darkneſs will annoy and trouble them: Ordinarily in the greateſt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs God commandeth ſome Light; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the upright there ariſeth Light in the darkneſs,</hi> Pſal. 112.4. <hi>The Lord will light my candle, the Lord my God will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33830:45"/>my darkneſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 18.28. But Hell is called the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Darkneſs; yea, <hi>outer darkneſs, Mat.</hi> 25.30. meaning a ſtate moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Heaven, the Kingdom of Light and Bleſſedneſs: We read of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that God cauſed a dreadful Darkneſs upon them, ſuch as might be felt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.21, 22, 23. Not only was the Light of the Celeſtial Bodies withdrawn, but ſuch groſs foggy Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours did ariſe, as ſome think, that might put out their Candles or other Lights; ſo that they ſate ſtill in their places for three days, being under the Arreſt of that Darkneſs; ſo that they knew not whether to go, nor what to do: But the Darkneſs of Hell will be much more afflictive and affrighting. Some are afraid of the natural Darkneſs of the Night, but how diſmal will thoſe chains of Darkneſs be, wherewith they who loved the darkneſs of ſin here, ſhall be bound in the Priſon of Hell hereafter, where they ſhall have Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs enough?</p>
            <p n="5">5. The worm will gnaw upon them:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33830:45"/>Of this Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44, 46, 48. <hi>Their Worm,</hi> that are in Hell-fire, of them he ſpeaks, <hi>v.</hi> 47. every one there hath his own Worm; not Literally, but Metaphorically to be taken, of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that holds reſemblance to it. A Worm in Scripture is put to reſemble two things;
<list>
                  <item>1. Something that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, <hi>Fear not thou worm</hi> Jacob: And</item>
                  <item>2. ſomething that is tormenting and vexatious, and ſo it is taken here:</item>
               </list> It is dreadful to Nature to have a Worm breed out of a man, and feed upon him; thus it is with the Body in the Grave, the Worms ſhall feed upon it, <hi>Job</hi> 24.20. But to have them breed in a man, and feed upon him alive, is more terrible. I have read of a Tyrant who deviſed that Torment, to keep a living man in his Coffin, and feed him till by his own filth he bred Worms, and thoſe Worms fed upon him, till he died by them. A ſad Judgment it was fell upon <hi>Herod,</hi> to be eaten up of Worms, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.23. But what is it then to have a worm gnaw upon the Soul? This is that Chriſt ſpeaks of;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:33830:46"/>This is nothing but the tormenting acts of Conſcience, termed a Worm;
<list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe as a Worm is bred out of the Putrefaction of the ſubject in which it is, ſo is this; there is much filth of ſin in the Conſcience, by which the Mind and Conſcience is defiled, <hi>Titus,</hi> 1.15. inwardly full of rottenneſs and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, as the Phariſees were, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. and this may eaſily breed Worms.</item>
                  <item>2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as Worms gnaw upon a man, ſo will a man's Conſcience gnaw upon him, when he ſhall think what offers of Grade and Salvation he had, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected them; what Motions of the Spirit in the Word and under the Rod he had, and quenched and reſiſted all, and would ſuffer nothing to prevail; how near he came to the Kingdom, and yet fell ſhort and is ſhut out: Thus will the Worm of Conſcience gnaw upon men, to their unexpreſſible Grief and Vexation.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The Fire will burn and torment them: <hi>I am tormented in this flame,</hi> ſaies one in Hell, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23, 24. The horror of Hell is ſet out by Fire, a Lake
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33830:46"/>of Fire; <hi>Fire and Brimſtone, and a burning Tempeſt,</hi> Pſal. 11.6. Whether material Fire or not, is not material; but ſuch as will torment Soul and Body beyond the hotteſt fire that men can make; for the breath of the Lord, as a River of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, will kindle it. The fire of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>'s, furnace was terrible, being ſeven times hotter than ordinary, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. The Fire God rained from Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> was very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. The Fire that burnt down the chief City of this Nation, in 1666, was fierce and furious; the Fire that will burn down the World at the laſt Day, will be more dreadful yet: but the Fire of Hell will be more terrible than all the reſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Deſpair will greatly afflict them: they will be there without hope of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping from under all the former evils. To be in a Valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> and ſee no door of Hope; to be in a ſtormy Sea, and have no Anchor of Hope to ſtay upon, muſt needs make a mans caſe deſperate: In Hell all Hope is cut off, which makes the heart to break: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33830:47"/>man on this ſide Hell is a man of Hope; <hi>To him that is joyned to all the living there is Hope,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.4. But in Hell there is no out-let of Hope; the Hypocrites Hope periſheth, <hi>Job</hi> 8.14. This will wound more cruelly than the Devil can do. Hope deferred makes the heart ſick; but Hope utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed will make the heart break. In Hell the Hypocrites Hope ſhall periſh, and the Cobweb Hopes of wicked men will be ſwept down, and be as the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up of the Ghoſt: Here if men be in great Afflictions, and under the guilt of great Tranſgreſſions, there is upon their putting their mouths in the duſt, Hope in <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning theſe matters; but there is no Hope that Sin will be pardoned or Miſeries be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. <hi>Spes alit Agricolas.</hi> The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman plows in Hope, and ſoweth in Hope: Here men pray in hope, and hear and weep in Hope; but in Hell their Cries and Tears are hopeleſs, Seas of Tears will not quench one ſpark of the fire, and this Deſpair links and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments them beyond expreſſion.</p>

            <p n="8">8. The place in which they ſuffer theſe things, will yet aggravate their Miſery; 'Tis called a Pit, a Pit without water, a bottomleſs Pit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s Pit, <hi>Jeremie</hi>'s Dungeon, <hi>Paul</hi>'s Priſon, and <hi>Bonner</hi>'s Cole-houſe were pleaſant and delightful places, compared with this: The worſt place on Earth is infinitely better than the beſt place in Hell.

            <p n="9">9.

Not one good perſon among them: It will raiſe the happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that not one wicked perſon ſhall be there, not an Hypocrite among them; and it will no leſs aggravate the Miſery of Hell, that none but ſuch are
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33830:48"/>there. It was a grief of mind to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> to be among the Daughters of <hi>Heth, Gen.</hi> 27. <hi>ult.</hi> The filthy company and ways of the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were a vexation to the Soul of juſt and righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>David</hi> when forced to dwell in <hi>Meſech,</hi> cries, <hi>Wo is me.</hi> How will they lament in Hell, where dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Devils will be their Society, and theſe Companions their cruel Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors? So they are called, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.24. The Devils are great Tormentors of the Bodies and Souls of men. It was the Saying of a good man, <hi>I had rather endure all the Torments men can deviſe, than ſee the Devil with my bodily eyes:</hi> What a miſerable caſe will theirs in Hell be, who ſhall both ſee and feel them their cruel Tormentors, who will have no Pity, ſhew no Mercy, will not ſpare; but cruciate and afflict as much as they are able?</p>
            <p n="10">10. The Eternity of all the former Evils, doth and will aggravate the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of them in Hell; they are puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, and ſhall never

Eſay 33. Jude 7. <hi>The blackneſs of darkneſs for ever,</hi> Jude 7. All this is without mitigation, intermiſſion, or ceſſation. O! who can bear it? If they in Hell might have eaſe but one hour in a thouſand years, it were ſome comfort; but there the ſmoak of their Torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever, and they have no reſt night nor day. If after Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years a man might be taken up out of Torments, the hopes of that would ſupport; but there they muſt lye in the ſcorching flames of God's Wrath for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: O, who can endure unquenchable Fire! Did we conſider what an Eternity of Torment is, to live ever dying, and yet never dye; to be in a Circle of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that knows no End, in Variety and Extremity of Pains that have no Period; but after a man hath been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe Torments as many Ages, as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:33830:49"/>many Millions of Ages, as there have been Moments or Minutes ſince the Creation, he is as far from coming out, as he was in the firſt moment he went in; O how inconceivable dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful will this be! Now People think Prayers long, and Sermons long, and Sabbaths long; O what a Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are they to many! But how long will an Eternal Hell be to ſuch? There they will be held down ever, ever, ever, to feel the ſtroke of infinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wrath; and though men will not believe this report, yet their unbelief ſhall not make God a Liar; for he hath ſaid it, and will ſurely perform it upon all them that live and dye overcome by the power of Sin, Satan, Antichriſt, and the World. O! how glad would wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men and women be, could they blot out the word Eternal out of the Holy Scriptures, but it cannot be! Some think it cannot ſtand with the juſtice of God to puniſh men eternally, for ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in time; yet if men did conſider what God is, they would never make this objection: If men did conſider an
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33830:49"/>infinite God is offended, and juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that an infinite ſatisfaction be made; men are finite and cannot receive an infinite puniſhment in time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtly ſuffer to all eternity. Even men account it but a juſt and righteous thing to lay up thoſe in Priſon all their life, or to take away the lives of thoſe for ever from the earth, who ſteal, or break open Houſes, or kill men, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully murder, though theſe acts were done in a very little time: And may not God who is infinite, juſtly inflict infinite torments? The circumſtance of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt whom any act is done, much aggravates or leſſens the fault, and ſo the puniſhment. It's more to ſtrike a Prince than an ordinary man, and deſerves a greater puniſhment: Sin is committed againſt an infinite Majeſty, therefore juſtly puniſhed to all eternity. Beſides, if men ſhould live on earth for ever, they would ſin againſt God for ever, and therefore may juſtly ſuffer for ever. Some ſay thus, Man ſins <hi>in ſuo aeterno,</hi> and therefore is juſtly puniſhed <hi>in aeterno Dei.</hi> There is in every ſinner, <hi>infinita volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas

Thus much may ſuffice to ſhew wherein the hurt of the ſecond death lies, <hi>viz.</hi> in a privation of good, in an inundation of all evils, ſhame, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the curſe, the worm, the fire, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, deſpair, the place, the company, and the eternity of all theſe; This, this is the hurt of the ſecond death.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Why ſhall not thoſe that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come be hurt of the ſecond death?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe Chriſt died for them; not for an example only, but in their room and ſtead; when they were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſinners, Chriſt died for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 10. He died not for his own ſins, he had no ſin inherent in him, he did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah ſhall be cut off, but not for himſelf,</hi> ſays the Prophet, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26. but he was delivered for our offences, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> And he died not as a private perſon, but as a ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33830:50"/>not as a private perſon, but as the head of all mankind, in him all have ſinned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. So Chriſt died as the publick repreſentative of all in him, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſaid in the Scriptures to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with him, and dead with him, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually; and this death which he ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to for them was no natural, no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary death, but the very ſecond Death the Text ſpeaks of, ſo far as God thought to be ſufficient, and as the excellency of his perſon was capable of; ſo far as that Divine Juſtice is ſatisfied, the Law ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and all Enemies vanquiſhed in the main, and ſo broken, as they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recover ſtrength to conquer finally the weakeſt true Believer. Though he did not deſpair, nor endure his Sufferings eternally; for being God-man, his Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty made his Sufferings of infinite Value and Vertue, though he was under them but for a time; And 'tis very probable he endured in his Agony in the Garden, and upon the Croſs, even the whole of what Believers muſt elſe have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for ever: Great was the ſhame caſt upon him; He was a Man of Sorrows,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33830:51"/>and acquainted with Grief, even from his Cradle to his Croſs; from his Birth to his Burial: He was made a Curſe for them. God his Father hid his face from him; yea, laid his ſevere hand of Juſtice and Wrath upon him: He ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his own Son, but was pleaſed to bruiſe him, and put him to grief. O the pains he endured both in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul! His Soul was made an Offering for ſin, and he bare our ſins in his own Body on the Tree, <hi>Eſay</hi> 57. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. And this, that all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers might not be hurt by the ſecond Death, either in Body or Soul: He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent the Curſe, that they might inherit the Bleſſing; He was wounded for their Tranſgreſſions, that they through his Stripes might be healed; He died this Death for them, that they might live through him an Eternal Life. I have read of a Bird, which if it comes near a man, who is troubled with the Yellow Jaundice, it attracts the Diſeaſe to it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cures the ſick perſon; but the Bird dies Chriſt took our Nature and S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33830:51"/>believeth in him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but have everlaſting Life. Now Chriſt having by his Blood given full Satisfaction, God the great Creditor will not exact the ſame Debt twice, of the Surety and of the Debtor too; but they are reckoned to have diſcharged all in him, to dye in him and riſe in him, and ſo to overcome in him; and therefore cannot, ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond Death.</p>

This Doctrine, well conſidered and applied, gives ſtrong Conſolation to all true Believers; it is a great relief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fears of outward Troubles, and of bodily Death, that King of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and Terrour of Kings: Though they may come under the ſmart of the firſt, (which yet the Lord can make eaſie to them) yet they are free from the hurt of the ſecond Death, which is indeed the ſting of the firſt; <hi>The ſting of Death is Sin:</hi> this they overcome in Chriſt. A Fly makes as great a noiſe as a Bee, yet we fear it not ſo much, becauſe it hath no Sting: So here, Death hath loſt its Sting as to true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33830:52"/>though it may terrific Nature, yet it ſhall not prove deadly to them. Chriſt threatens ſome, that he will kill their Children with Death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23. Some are killed with Death; all dye, even the good as well as the wicked; but all are not killed with Death, Death proves not deadly to any true Believer.</p>
            <p>A good man once ſaid, That he did <hi>Aegrotare vitaliter;</hi> ſo all holy men and women do <hi>Mori vitaliter:</hi> Death lays its hand upon all, but the time cometh when this hand ſhall be cut off, even at the Reſurrection, but no Power farther than to carry to the Grave; and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will ranſome them from the power of the Grave, I will redeem them from Death,</hi> Hoſ. 13.14. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deliver them over to wrath, or carry a good man in Chains to the Priſon of Hell: This is to be killed with Death. A Believer may ſay, <hi>O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? Thanks be to God, who giveth us the Victory through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.56, 57. Once paſt the firſt Death, you are for ever free from all fear of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33830:52"/>Death: This Life is on this account miſerable, that it is in fear of Death hanging over it every moment: <hi>What is your Life,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James, it is a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour that now is, and quickly vaniſhes away,</hi> Jam. 4.13, 14. But after this, no more fear of Death to a true Chriſtian. And to make the Joy of ſuch full, there is a <hi>Meioſis</hi> in this Text; when it is ſaid they ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond Death, it implies, that they ſhall be called to a bleſſed and immortal Life: Not only not aſhamed, but have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and confidence before Chriſt at his coming; not only ſorrow and ſighing will flee away, but everlaſting Joy ſhall be upon their heads; not only free from the Curſe, but ſhall hear a <hi>Come ye bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;</hi> not only no Deſpair, but no doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; yea, a perpetual Plerophory and full Aſſurance of their happy ſtate; not only no Worm of an accuſing Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but the teſtimony of an abſolving Conſcience, which will be a continual Feaſt; not only no Torments of Hell, but the Pleaſures of Heaven; not only no <hi>Canaanites</hi> in that Land, no Devil,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33830:53"/>no wicked men, but the Society of holy Angels and Saints, and God's glorious Preſence to all Eternity. Why ſhould not all ſincere Believers comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and one another, with theſe things, and that in the worſt of times? A Martyr, being offered Life if he would renounce the Truth, anſwered, <hi>Can you give me Eternal Life?</hi> And being threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Death for refuſal, he ſaid, <hi>You cannot bring me under the ſecond Death, you cannot put me to Eternal Death; You can kill my Body, but that's all you can do. I muſt fear to offend him, that can deſtroy Body and Soul in Hell. Better it is,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>that I have a little Wormwood in my Mouth a while, than to have my Bowels filled with it for ever.</hi> Oh! how would the Improvement of this Text and Truth ſupport and comfort a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, in the ſaddeſt conditions he may be called to paſs through in this world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. Is it thus, that Overcomers ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond Death? Then let us all make out for true Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; for this is the Victory whereby we overcome the World, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33830:53"/>all that is in the World, even our Faith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. This is the firſt Reſurrection, which whoſoever hath a part in is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; If you ask wherein are ſuch bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? The Text tells you, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.6. <hi>On ſuch the ſecond death hath no power.</hi> Some underſtand this of Romiſh Idolatries and Superſtitions, for it is ſaid, If any man worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, the ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb: And they have no reſt night nor day who worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and whoſoever recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the mark of his name: which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, ſay they, that thoſe who live and dye under the dominion of thoſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian abominations in Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Practice, and riſe not by true Faith in Chriſt, and Repentance towards God, will fall under the power of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death. 'Tis ſaid, every living ſoul
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33830:54"/>died in the Sea; for it became as the Blood of a dead man, when the Vial was poured out upon it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.3. Whence ſome have concluded, that thoſe under the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Juriſdiction, who live and dye under the full Dominion and Practice of their Idolatrous wicked Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Worſhip, cannot be ſaved. But others take this firſt Reſurrection, to be meant of a Spiritual quickning to a Divine Life, the Dead hear the Voice of the Son of God in the Goſpel, and live; this is when Faith is firſt wrought, which is the beginning of the Soul's life and ſtrength, the firſt born of graces, the bond of Union between Chriſt and Believers, and ſo brings all the ſtrength and Grace of Chriſt into their hearts, for Chriſt and all his Fulneſs dwelleth there by Faith, and by that is derived to the Soul, to enable it to overcome all its Enemies: Where this is not wrought, Sin and Satan do conquer and utterly deſtroy the Soul. <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall dye in your ſins,</hi> ſaies Chriſt to the Jews, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.21, 24. Should any one come and tell us,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33830:54"/>You ſhall die in a Ditch, or in a Goal, it would ſound harſhly in our ears; but for Chriſt to ſay, <hi>Ye ſhall dye in your ſins,</hi> is yet more dreadful: For a man may die in a Ditch, or in a Priſon, and yet go to Heaven; but if any one die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the full power of Sin and Satan, a dead Dog is better than he; it had been good for that man he had never been born, for he drops preſently into Hell, and the Second Death hath an irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable Power over him; he can never get from under it, becauſe all his Sins will be laid upon him. If a Debtor be Arreſted and caſt into Priſon, no ſooner do his Creditors underſtand it, but they come and bring in their ſeveral Actions, that a man muſt lye there all his days. Thus if the firſt Death Arreſt us, and we under the full Dominion of ſin, Satan comes in, Conſcience comes in, the Law comes in; yea, God himſelf comes in, all come in and lay Action upon Action againſt us, and there we muſt lye, till the laſt Mite be paid: which becauſe we can never do, we muſt lye there to all Eternity. We live in very
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33830:55"/>dying Times, and none can tell how ſoon the thred of his Life may be cut; If we look not diligently to it, we ſhall dye in our ſins, and ſo be undone for ever. O let us look and get true Faith, for it is he that believes that overcomes, and he that overcomes ſhall not be hurt of the Second Death.</p>

            <p>WE have here another of thoſe excellent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers: It is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding words of that Epiſtle to the Church in <hi>Pergamos,</hi> as in the 12th Verſe is evident. Some ſay this was a great City, diſtant from <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:33830:56"/>Two hundred and twenty eight miles, very populous, but very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: Hence we read, Satan's ſeat was there. A King ruleth over all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, yet he hath his Throne in ſome chief City of the Land. Satan that <hi>King of the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> as he is ſtiled, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1. reigns over all wicked men; yet in thoſe notoriouſly wicked, he may be ſaid to have his ſeat. This was, ſay ſome, the Seat or Court of <hi>Attalus,</hi> in whoſe time it was written, <hi>Diſcedat ab Aula, qui velit eſſe plus:</hi> Like that to the Prophet, <hi>Flee thee away, O thou Seer, for it is the King's Court,</hi> Amos 7.13. Afterwards it was the Seat of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> perſecuting Governours, (who were Satan's chief Inſtruments, in afflicting and deſtroying the Saints) and ſo is called Satan's ſeat. Chriſt takes ſpecial notice of the places of his peoples abode, <hi>I know where thou dwelleſt, even where Satans Seat is:</hi> He obſerves how peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a place this <hi>Pergamos</hi> was, and what dangers as to Liberty and Life his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were in here. <hi>Antipas</hi> had already ſuffered Martyrdom for the Truth, (the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33830:56"/>name of ſome good Miniſter, or of the Paſtor of that Church, as many judge) an Honour not granted to the Angels of Heaven, as <hi>Latimer</hi> ſaith; yet we find a Church planted and preſerved here, who held faſt his Name, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as with tooth and nail, or by main ſtrength. Chriſt will have to do where Satan reigns; ſome good he will have in the worſt places; a remnant of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ones in a crooked and perverſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. As Satan had a <hi>Judas</hi> among the Apoſtles, a <hi>Demas</hi> among the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, a <hi>Simon Magus</hi> among the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; ſo the Lord had a <hi>Noah</hi> in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly world, a <hi>Job</hi> in an Idolatrous <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z,</hi> a <hi>Lot</hi> in filthy <hi>Sodom,</hi> a <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s Court, Saints in <hi>Nero</hi>'s houſe, and ſome that held faſt the Truth even in <hi>Pergamos</hi> itſelf; thoſe he reſerves to be Witneſſes for him, and to teſtifie againſt thoſe to their Condemnation, who will not by their good Example be brought to Converſion. Let us all labour to be good in evil Times, it's excellent in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and will be our commendation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ at laſt, as appears by his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:33830:57"/>Teſtimony of them here; <hi>Thee have I found righteous before me,</hi> ſaies the Lord to <hi>Noah, in this Generation,</hi> Gen. 7.1. What kind of Generation that was, is ſet down; It was a time when Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty abounded, all fleſh had corrupted their way, a deluge of wickedneſs had covered the Earth; for <hi>Noah</hi> now to be righteous, was excellent indeed: And it will be our glory, if we ſtudy to be Lights in a dark World, holy among the filthy, Lilies among Thorns, and as the Fiſh, freſh in Salt-waters. This may comfort us alſo in very evil Times, Chriſt will preſerve ſome from the ſtroak of Perſecution; <hi>Antipas</hi> was ſlain, yet ſome did remain; ſome, yea many may ſuffer hard things, yea 'tis poſſible ſome particular Churches may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated, yet a Church Chriſt will have on Earth, againſt which the Gates of Hell, Satan's Seat ſhall not prevail. Many Faithful ones may be removed by a natural or violent Death, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt lives, therefore his Truth ſhall live, his Cauſe and Intereſt ſhall live, and ſurvive all Enemies and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33830:57"/>Let this help our Faith and Joy, though we dwell where Satan's ſeat is. <hi>Rome</hi> Antichriſtian is now eſteemed that Seat of the Beaſt, mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.10. yet even there God hath his People, <hi>Come out of her my People,</hi> ſaies the Lord, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. A People Chriſt had, and ſtill hath, where Antichriſt moſt prevails, though it greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them to come out thence, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to continue there, both for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Sin, and for Infliction of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as this Scripture expreſſeth, <hi>Come out, that ye partake not of her Sins, and receive not of her Plagues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, That Mice will haſten out of a houſe that is ready to fall on their heads; And Spiders with their Webs will drop, before the houſe falls. Certainly, Antichriſt's ruine haſtens, and <hi>Babylons</hi> Fall approacheth, Come out of her therefore. O all the People of God, Come out from her Idolatries, be ye ſeparate from all her Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Corruptions. And to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all to ſtrive to get Victory over the Evil of Evil Times, this further
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33830:58"/>Promiſe in the Text is given to them of <hi>Pergamos,</hi> and to us in them; the ſum whereof take in this Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That Overcomers ſhall have ſuch ſpecial and peculiar Favours given them by Chriſt, as none know but they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.</hi> There are ſome things in which the men of the world intercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the Saints; as, Natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, Worldly Enjoyments, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Church-Priviledges, the common Gifts of the Spirit, and ſuperficial Taſtes of Heavenly things; <hi>Abſalom</hi> had Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as well as, yea, greater than <hi>David; Herod</hi> and <hi>Jonadab</hi> had Wit and Policy as well as <hi>Joſeph;</hi> the Fool in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, was rich as well as <hi>Abraham;</hi> the fooliſh Virgins were in Church-Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as well as the wiſe; Apoſtates, ſuch as are not renewed to Repentance, may taſte the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come, as well as thoſe who had better things in them, even things that accompany, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that have Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them: <hi>Saul</hi> had the Gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, <hi>Judas</hi> Gifts of Preaching, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33830:58"/>and working Miracles, as well as the other Apoſtles; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, there are peculiar benefits Believers ſhare in, which others have no part, no lot in: <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant, Pſal.</hi> 25.14. Not here meant of his providence, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him in outward things; of this <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, ſaying, <hi>The Secret of God was upon his Tabernacle,</hi> Job 29.4. But the underſtanding of the myſteries of his Word and Covenant (hid from the wiſe and prudent of the World) and their own intereſt in them.</p>
            <p>Believers are the friends of God; as <hi>Abraham</hi> was called the friend of God, <hi>James</hi> 2. So Chriſt called his Diſciples friends; now the ſecret Cabinet is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockt and ſet open to a friend, though ſhut to ſtrangers. <hi>Amicus alter idem:</hi> A friend is another ſelf; and a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceal any thing from himſelf, and therefore not from his friend. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt heard of his Father he made known to his friends, <hi>John</hi> 15.15. <hi>His ſecret is with the righteous, Prov.</hi> 3.32.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33830:59"/>the very <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> the myſteries of the Kingdom are made plain to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.10. It is a favour to be of the Kings Court, but more to be of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; Courtiers know more than thoſe that live far remote from the Kings Court; but Counſellors know his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, the Privy-Counſellor is acquainted with the ſpecial myſteries of State. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal profeſſors and hypocrites may know many truths, which Heathens who live not under the ſound of the Goſpel may be ignorant of, and in an ordinary way cannot know; yet are they but of the Court; Believers only are of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, to whom the myſteries of grace and godlineſs are diſcloſed. It is ſaid, the Lord told <hi>Samuel</hi> in his ear, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.15. When a man tells his friend a ſecret he would not have others know, he whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers in his ear; ſo the Lord deals with his People, he reveals thoſe ſecrets to them which every one ſhall not know; which indeed eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath entred into the hearts of other men: Theſe God reveals to Believers by his ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10. On
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33830:59"/>this account is the Church ſtiled by Chriſt a Garden encloſed, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are Believers, as to their perſons, ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed that they cannot fall away and miſs of ſalvation, nor are the graces of ſuch only ſo encloſed that they periſh not; but they are alſo encloſed in their myſtical enjoyments, that none partake of them but themſelves; To which agreeth that Prov. 14.10. <hi>The heart knoweth its own bitterneſs, and a ſtranger doth not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with his joy.</hi> Believers have bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſweet, liſtings up and caſtings down, ſorrows and joys peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>You will ſay, What are thoſe ſpecial favours Chriſt gives thoſe that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, which others cannot receive?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are many of theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar tokens of ſpecial love he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon them that by faith get Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over their ſpiritual Enemies as true Believers do: we read that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave the ſons of the Concubines por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſent them away, but to <hi>Iſaac</hi> he gave all that he had, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25, 5, 6. God gives portions in this Life even to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33830:60"/>all, to the worſt of men; but ſome things Believers have, others ſhare not in; They have the Lord for their God, in a peculiar covenant-relation: 'tis ſaid, he is not aſhamed to be called their God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. others have none of the life of God given them, none of the fulneſs of God, none of the peculiar knowledge of God, no ſpecial intereſt in the attributes of God, none of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving influential goodneſs of God; all which the Saints receive. Yea, they partake of Chriſt, they have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.16. others are without Chriſt, no right to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, no intereſt in the Promiſes; no reconciliation, no righteouſneſs, no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, no ſalvation, for theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are derived to men by Faith in Chriſt; I might adde, Believers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are partakers of the ſpirit of God; <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>even the Spirit of Truth, whom the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive,</hi> John 14.16, 17. And he is to them a Spirit of Light and Wiſdom, a Spirit of Power and Love, and of a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33830:60"/>ſound mind, a ſpirit of Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a ſpirit of Love and joy, none of which things others partake of. But I wave thoſe, and confine my diſcourſe to thoſe in the Text.</p>

This none but themſelves can be admitted to ſhare in, for without are the fearful and the unbelievers: Here they eat by Faith, there by ſight; here now and then a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as they are able to bear, there fully and without intermiſſion: Here when the King ſits at the table, their ſpiknard ſends forth its ſavour, their graces and gracious affections ſlow forth; What will

            <p n="2">2. White Stones were given of old in the Abſolution of Malefactors, as black ones were given to perſons Condemned, as a Token they muſt dye; ſo white ones to them acquitted in their Courts of Judicature. 'Tis as if Chriſt had ſaid, To him that overcometh will I give an evidence of the Remiſſion of his Sins. And what a Fountain of Conſolation is in this particular? <hi>Son, be of good chear, thy Sins are forgiven thee,</hi> Mat. 9.2. Well might he be cheerful; to have the aſſurance of our ſins being pardoned, is able to make any one everlaſtingly merry; Yea, though under preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: This Palſy-man was not cured
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33830:65"/>of his diſeaſe, when Chriſt bid him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; yet ground enough of joy he had, to be aſſured from Chriſt's own mouth that his ſins were forgiven him. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquity is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered,</hi> Pſal. 32.1. for this is an infallible evidence of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: outward mercies we may receive from an angry God, ſilver and gold, and precious ſtones in abundance, and yet from the wrath of God; but this white ſtone of Abſolution is a certain token of Love and Reconciliation. 'Tis not a giving-God for our Bodies that can give grounds of Comfort ſo much, as a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving-God for our Souls can do. This evidenceth our Redemption by Chriſt, In him we have Redemption through his Blood, the Forgiveneſs of Sin: This bringeth Salvation. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the face of the Lord was, <hi>To give knowledg of Salvation to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by the remiſſion of their Sins,</hi> Epheſ. 1.7. Luke 1.77. Reconciliation ſtands in it; <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their ſins,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. In a word, it is the inlet
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33830:65"/>to, and uſhers in all other Good and Mercy; <hi>Take away all Iniquity,</hi> and take up good, or give us good, as it is, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. They muſt pray for good, <hi>O but your Sins keep good things from you,</hi> Jer. 5.25. Therefore firſt their requeſt is, <hi>Take away all Iniquity:</hi> No good to be given, till ſin be forgiven; but when that is removed that withholds good from them, then the paſſage is cleared, and way is made for all good to come unto them: It makes way for the Liberty and Deliverance of the Church from Troubles, <hi>Speak comfortably to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>tell her that her Iniquity is pardoned, and her Warfare is accompliſhed:</hi> When Sin was pardoned, her Afflictions and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſoon had an end: It brings health to a whole Land. The Inhabitant of the Land ſhall not ſay, I am ſick; the Land ſhall be free from infectious, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential and Epidemical Diſeaſes. How comes this about? <hi>The People that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their Iniquity,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay 33.24. Oh this is that which ſweetens all other Comforts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments; as the want of it imbitters
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33830:66"/>all our ſweet things: What are we the better for Houſe, Land, Silver and Gold, when our Sin is not pardoned, when the Curſe and Wrath of God hangs over our heads, and is ready in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to fall upon us, and arreſt us every moment, to draw us to Hell for ever? But then Mercies are Mercies indeed, when they come to us in the ſtream of Chriſt's Blood, with a Pardon in their hand. Hence Believers are taught to pray, <hi>Give us this day our dayly Bread, and forgive us our ſins;</hi> to ſhew, that our Bread is ſweet, when it comes with pardoning Mercy. God had given <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> the healing his Diſeaſes, and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with loving Kindneſs and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercies. What made it ſo, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Mercy? Firſt he ſets down that, <hi>Who forgiveth all thine Iniquities;</hi> then follow the other Mercies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.2, 3, 4. Pardoning Mercy is Crowning Mercy. Yea, this fits us for holy Duties; Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Sacraments: as ſin unpardoned makes God hide his face, that he will not hear, or appear to the Soul. It turns Prayer into Sin, and Sacraments into
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:33830:66"/>Sin: So if this be taken away, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is accepted, and then all Duties are accepted, and God will be ſeen in them to the Soul, and give it communion with himſelf. In a word, this fits us for a Suffering ſtate and time. How will the ſenſe of Pardon, that aſſures a man he ſhall never be caſt into Hell-fire, make him even willingly embrace and ſubmit to a Fiery Trial for Chriſt's ſake? It prepares for Death, whether natural or violent. All muſt die, and as a mans Death is, ſuch is his Doom: As Death leaves us, Judgment findes us. <hi>Job</hi> prayed earneſtly for the white Stone of Abſolution, as it is an excellent prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative for his Diſſolution; <hi>And why doſt thou not pardon my ſin, for now ſhall I ſleep in the duſt?</hi> Job 7.21. As if he had ſaid, Lord, my great Afflictions ſeem to haſten on my great change, and therefore now eſpecially I beg the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of my ſin, and the ſenſe of it unto my Soul, and then I am prepared to ſleep in the duſt. We ſhould not lye down in our Beds, much leſs in our Graves, with ſin unpardoned: If that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33830:67"/>be taken away, no matter how ſoon we dye; <hi>Feri Domine, feri, tantum ignoſce mihi peccatum,</hi> ſaid <hi>Luther;</hi> Smite me, Lord, ſmite as thou wilt, though by ſharp Afflictions or Death, all is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, if ſin be forgiven: This is that the Lord here promiſeth to victorious Chriſtians, when he ſaith, <hi>He will give them the white Stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Anew name written in the Stone,</hi> is the third and laſt of thoſe ſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours promiſed to Overcomers in the Text. There are ſome that take it to be an Alluſion to that Cuſtome of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Stones to men, with their Names written on them, as Tickets, ſhewing them ſuch as ſhould be admitted to thoſe Solemn Feaſts, held in honour of thoſe that were Victorious in their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Games: Then the meaning is, that Chriſt will give conquering Chriſtians a privy Mark, whereby they may be known and admitted to the Heavenly Banquet of the hidden Manna, as wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Gueſts. And, O! how high a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is it to carry the Privy-Seal of Heaven about us? To have a Token
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33830:67"/>that we ſhall be taken up to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Supper of the Lamb, when others ſhall not taſte of thoſe Dainties? But moſt take the new Name here to be <hi>Filius Dei,</hi> an Adopted Son of God, and make it an Alluſion to that of <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> 65.15. <hi>God ſhall call his Servants by another Name.</hi> A name better than the name of Sons and Daughters: For by this they are Called and Tranſlated out of the old family of Sin and Satan, to be of the Family of God, of the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of Faith; a Priviledge far excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the civil Adoption in uſe among men; for he takes many Sons and brings them to Glory, a man but one: And when he hath done that, he cannot communicate his own Likeneſs to him. But God with the new Name gives a new Nature; with the Spiritual Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conveys a Principle of the Divine Nature, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. If a man adopts, it is either becauſe he hath no Son of his own, or elſe becauſe his Son is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal and diſobedient; but God had a Son from all Eternity, one who never diſpleaſed or diſobliged him in thought,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:33830:68"/>word, or deed: So that this new Name giving is an act of free and rich Grace. <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1. If men Adopt, it is but to ſome earthly Inheritance; But God gives an <hi>Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> in light, <hi>incorruptible, undefiled, that never fadeth away, reſerved in Heaven for them,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. So that all his Children are Heirs, <hi>Heirs of God, and Joint-heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Roman. 8.17. <hi>Heirs of the Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 6.17. <hi>Heirs of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith,</hi> Heb. 11.7. <hi>Heirs of Salvation, of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Heb. 1. <hi>ult. Jam.</hi> 2.5. They have a glorious Liberty, called <hi>The Liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.21. A Liberty from ſins Dominion and Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, from the Covenant and Curſe of the Law, from the Power of Satan, the World, and Death. They have a gracious Acceſs to God their Father, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father,</hi> ſaies the Prodigal, Luk. 15. And his pity in all their Troubles: <hi>As a Father pities his Children, ſo the Lord pities them that fear
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33830:68"/>him,</hi> Pſal. 103.13. They have acceſs with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace, and have his eye, his ear, his heart and his hand. We read of a Child., who finding himſelf not well, ran to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cried out, <hi>My head, my head,</hi> 2 King. 4.19. Thus may God's Children go to him, and ſay, My head, my heart. Oh! this ignorant head, Father, enlighten it; Oh this carnal heart! Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſpiritualize it; Oh this dead, hard, earthly, divided heart of mine! Father, quicken, ſoften, make Heavenly, and compoſe it, unite my heart to fear thy Name: Yea, as a Father ſpares his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Son, ſo the Lord will ſpare his, <hi>As a man ſpares his own Son that ſerves him,</hi> Malac. 3.17. If he correct them, it is in love and in meaſure, and he will provide for them here; <hi>Your Heavenly Father knoweth you have need of all theſe things,</hi> Matt. 6. Jeſus Chriſt is your Brother, he is not aſhamed to call you Brethren, the Angels are your Guard; the King's Son hath the Nobles and Peers of the Realm to wait upon him: The Angels are all Miniſtring Spirits
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33830:69"/>ſent forth for their good: yea, you ſhall be ever with your Father. <hi>The Son a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in the houſe for ever,</hi> John 8. as that Father ſaid, Luke 15. <hi>Son, thou art ever with me.</hi> He that is a Servant to day, may be none to morrow; but if God be a Father, and we his Children by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, this relation abides unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, he is an everlaſting Father, and we his Sons and Daughters for ever. O what an excellent Priviledge is this new Name here promiſed! To be a Son of God, is an old Name, for <hi>Adam</hi> was called <hi>the ſon of God;</hi> but it was only by Creation: The Angels in that ſenſe are alſo called the Sons of God; but to which of all the Angels did ever God ſay, Thou art my Adopted Son? This is the new Name here ſpoken of, and is the peculiar Priviledg of true Believers. 'Tis ſtoried, That <hi>Alexander</hi> the Conquerour was by the flattering Oracle ſaluted as a Son of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> but the Believer, who overcomes the Devil, Sin, and the World, in a more noble Spiritual way, is by the true Oracle ſtiled, the Son of God; <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33830:69"/>Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe in his Name,</hi> Joh. 1.12. The Believer is no longer a mere Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> but in the inſtant of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is united to Chriſt the natural Son of God, and ſo becomes an Adopted one. And this is not an empty Title, For they are born of God, and are of the Seed-royal of Heaven; yea, this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption is, <hi>Quaedam Similitudo Filiationis aeterni,</hi> as a Learned man expreſſes it, a Shadow of the Eternal One.</p>
            <p>The natural ſon is the Image of Gods nature, <hi>the brightneſs of his Fathers glory, and the expreſs Image of his perſon, Heb.</hi> 1.2. The adopted Son is the Image of his will, <hi>of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, James</hi> 1.18. And this puts a luſtre upon Believers, beyond what is to be ſeen upon the Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the earth. All the great ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling names thrown upon them by men, is but, <hi>fumus ſeculi,</hi> a little ſmoke which quickly is ſcattered; but this divine Adoption is, <hi>radius coeli,</hi> a beam of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory, which makes them ſhine in the eyes of the Angels, and continues
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:33830:70"/>an indelible character upon them. You ſee by theſe things ſomewhat of the new name here promiſed, and is this a little matter in any mans account? When <hi>Sauls</hi> ſervants told <hi>David</hi> of the purpoſes the King had to give him one of his Daughters to wife, <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Seemeth it a light thing to any of you to be a Kings Son-in-law, ſeeing I am a poor man, and lightly eſteemed?</hi> 1 Sam. 18.23. What may Believers then ſay as to this Divine Adoption? Shall it be a light matter to be a Son or Daughter of the moſt high God, the King of Kings? That they who may ſay to corruption, Thou art my Father, or as 'tis ſaid, <hi>Thy Father was an</hi> Amorite, <hi>and thy Mother a</hi> Hittite, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſpirit of Adoption, crying, <hi>Abba,</hi> Father, even to God himſelf? This, This is that new Name which is here promiſed to all that overcome.</p>
            <p>I might here add Reaſons of this point; The love of God to them, his chuſing-love is the cauſe of this. <hi>The Lord loveth the righteous,</hi> Pſal. 146.8. Therefore <hi>his ſecret is with the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:33830:70"/>Prov. 3.32. <hi>Delilah</hi> could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Samſon</hi>'s love was ſo great to her as he pretended; becauſe he told her not that great ſecret, where his ſtrength lay. It ſprings alſo from the purchaſe of Chriſt: He bought a peculiar people, and purchaſed for them peculiar favours: Their common, much more their ſpecial Mercies are the price of Blood; and what Chriſt hath purchaſed, God will give out unto them: To all which, add his engagement by Promiſe, as in the Text, <hi>And faithful is he that hath promiſed.</hi> The <hi>

What knoweſt thou that we know not? What underſtandeſt thou that is not in us? Is there any ſecret thing with thee?</hi> Job 15.8, 9, 11. Yet Believers do know and underſtand what worldly men know not, <hi>For the Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him.</hi> The Secrets of his Counſel are reſerved in his own breaſt; but the Secrets of his Providence are many times revealed to them; <hi>Surely, the Lord will do nothing, but he revealeth his Secrets to his Servants the Prophets,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos 3.7, And the Lord himſelf ſaith of <hi>Abraham, Shall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>the thing that I will do?</hi> Yea, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of his Truth are with Believers; for he hath promiſed his Spirit of Truth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33830:71"/>ſhall lead them into all Truth; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of his Love and Grace are with them, of which the world knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, no more than of the Word of God, which the Spirit only can ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover, which <hi>Spirit the world cannot reeeive,</hi> Joh. 14.16, 17. As wicked men have <hi>Bread which they eat in ſecret,</hi> Prov. 9.17. of which good men deſire no knowledg; ſome ſecret Luſt which is as a ſweet Morſel under their Tongue, as to which good men are ready to ſay with the Patriarch, <hi>O my Soul, come not thou into their ſecret;</hi> or with <hi>David,</hi> Let me not eat of their dainties. So they that are truely good, have Spiritual Comforts peculiar to themſelves, which the world knows not of, never taſted of.

And that your Joy may be yet more full from this Text, conſider how much the Mercies promiſed in it, exceed the things alluded to; The <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> God rained down to <hi>Iſrael</hi> was Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, this is Spiritual; That came from the Clouds, this from the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from the boſome of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; That was hidden in the Dew and in the Golden Pot, this in the Virgins Womb, and now in the Heavens; that fed the Body, this the Soul; That was apt to breed Worms, and ſtink, this can ſee no corruption; That preſerved none
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33830:72"/>from Death, <hi>Your Fathers did eat Manna in the Wilderneſs, and are dead,</hi> Job. 6.49. But he that eats of this hidden Manna, lives for ever. So of the White Stone; They were material the <hi>Romans</hi> gave, this is Spiritual; They were inanimate, this is a Living Stone; Thoſe were Tokens of a Temporal Election and Abſolution, this of a Spiritual and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; Thoſe its probable were given ſometimes to vile and wicked perſons, this to none but true Believers. So for the new Name, it is a name of Dignity and Honour, excelling the names of the great ones of the Earth. Let Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers labour to drink in the Comfort of theſe things.</p>

Put on and handle well your Armour of Righteouſneſs, to repel and repulſe Temptations on the right hand and on the left; Set your Watch, and keep it ſtrictly, as Soldiers
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33830:73"/>muſt do upon Pain of Death. A Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier being aſleep when he ſtood Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, his Officer ran him through, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it an act of Juſtice to leeve him as he found him. It's a time of War, and our continual dangers ſhould move us not to ſleep as do others; but to watch and be ſober: Let Chriſtians keep cloſe to the Standard. 'Tis Death by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Law for Soldiers to run away from their Colours; they that forſake the Lord ſhall be conſumed. Follow Chriſt your Captain in all ways, dirty and clean, in all weathers fair and foul, in all Ordinances, in all Providences. <hi>If any man ſerve me, let him follow me,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.26. And ſtrive to make good your ground; yield not to your Spiritual Adverſaries. Divines obſerve there is no armour provided by Chriſt for the back, to ſhew, that we muſt give no ground to our Enemies. A Captain delights not in Renegadoes. <hi>If any man draws back, my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him, Heb.</hi> 10.38. They are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets words, ſay ſome; but God's, ſay others; It's true both ways: Neither
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:33830:73"/>God nor his People can take plea-pleaſure in Apoſtates. Fight couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly againſt your Spiritual Enemies; as for your Bodily Enemies, you have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rule, <hi>Love your Enemies, pray for them that perſecute you,</hi> Mat. 5. And if your Enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him drink: Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. But as to your Soul Enemies, fight manfully and ſtoutly againſt them, give them no Quarter: If you ſpare them, your Life, your Soul muſt go for it. It was the Saying of a Captain to his Soldiers, having the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and the Sea behind them, <hi>Either you muſt drink up this Sea, or eat up theſe</hi> Spaniards. So it is here, either we muſt fight and overcome our Sins, or drink up the Sea of God's Wrath. O ceaſe not combating, till all your foes be made your foot-ſtool. This Church of <hi>Pergamos</hi> was overcome by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Balaam</hi> and the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> holding both Adultery and Idolatry lawful, Doctrines pernicious to ſound Truth and a holy Life; only ſome held

Do not ſome go about to null the Eternal Decrees of God? to make void the Satisfaction of Chriſt? to deny and deride the Imputation of his Righteouſneſs to Believers in the matter of Juſtification? to maintain the Doctrine of Free-will, and final Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy from Grace? And doth it not then concern us to keep the word of Chriſt, as Soldiers muſt keep the Word their General gives them? ſo let all Chriſt's Soldiers keep the word of Precept, the word of Promiſe, and the word of his Patience, that he may make the ſame honourable report of you, which he doth of them, Joh. 17.6. <hi>And they have kept thy Word.</hi> Who knows how ſoon the ſame Trials may be upon us, that were upon <hi>Antipas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>HERE is another of thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes Chriſt makes to the Overcomers, though directed to the Officers and Members of the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> yet is written (as the other are) for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33830:76"/>benefit of theſe ſeven Churches, and of all others to the end of the World. This <hi>Thyatira</hi> was a City of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> not far from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> called <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateira,</hi> which doth ſignify a Daughter, as Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> obſerves; for as a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter new-born is always growing in age and ſtature, till ſhe comes to full ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo it was with this Church, which he therefore ſtiles, Growing <hi>Thyatira:</hi> The true Believers went on from faith to faith, and ſo conſequently conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and to conquer, Not like languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Epheſus,</hi> loſing their firſt lively affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and abating of their former active Converſation, but making progreſs in their Chriſtian courſe, and their laſt works more than the firſt: The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was commended for her firſt love and firſt works, and reproved for her declining from them; yea, threatned if ſhe did not return and recover them. <hi>David</hi>'s firſt ways were moſt free from ſcandal, thence it is that <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> is commended for <hi>walking in the firſt ways of</hi> David <hi>his Father,</hi> 2 Chron. 17.3. The love of too many that have been
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33830:76"/>very hot is grown cold to God and his ways; But theſe are Sea-marks, recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our caution, not Landmarks ſet down for our Direction or Imitation. This of <hi>Thyatira</hi> is an excellent Copy for all the Churches of Chriſt to write after; Our laſt works ſhould be more than the firſt; our laſt Sabbath better Sanctified than the former; our laſt love to one another more than the firſt, our laſt prayer better than the former; our Faith, Humility, and all other graces and good things, better in the end than in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. How ſad will our account be, if God ſhall find us declining in theſe things, and we doing worſe after twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or forty years profeſsion, than in our firſt entrance into his ways? That we are leſs careful in keeping holy the Lords-day than at firſt? Then we would call the Sabbath a Delight, the holy of the Lord and honourable, and would not unneceſſarily run into worldly talk; but now little elſe is heard from us, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle difference by obſervers can be made between that Day and an ordinary Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket or Fair-day. Is this to imitate <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atira</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:33830:77"/>and not <hi>Epheſus</hi> rather? No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God threatens to pluck all up, and to remove his Goſpel from a declining and degenerating people. Oh that yet we might remember whence we are fallen, and repent and do our firſt works! Yea, let the laſt be more than the firſt: The example of God above all ſhould prevail with us; As the Governour of the Feaſt ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Every man at the begining doth ſet forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worſe; but thou haſt kept the good wine till now,</hi> John 2.10. Gods firſt thoughts of love to us that are his people were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry precious, his electing love; His fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing works in our effectual Calling into the ſtate of Grace, and preſerving us therein, notwithſtanding all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of our Enemies, deſerves great admiration. But Heaven will be Heaven when all is done; His manifeſtations and communications there will be ſuch, as will force us to ſay, <hi>O Lord, thou haſt kept the beſt wine till the laſt?</hi> Thy firſt thoughts and works towards us and in us were wonderful, but yet the laſt are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33830:77"/>more than the firſt; How reaſonable is it then that we ſhould ſtrive to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Lord our God in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, leſt we looſe the things we have wrought, and receive not a full reward? And that we may labour to get victory over all the evils growing upon us, let us conſider this promiſe in the Text now before us; the ſum of which take in this Propoſition:</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That Chriſt will give great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and excellent glory unto Overcomers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are 4. things to be ſpoken too.
<list>
                  <item>1. Who are they that Overcome?</item>
                  <item>2. What is that great Power Chriſt will give them?</item>
                  <item>3. What is the Glory here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed?</item>
                  <item>4. The Reaſons of the Doctrine. Theſe will make way for the Uſe.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>Who are or may be ſaid to be Overcomers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Text gives a ſignificant anſwer to this Queſtion; He that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſts works unto the end. When it ſaith, <hi>He that overcometh,</hi> ſome will ask, who is he? How ſhall we know him? He addeth; <hi>and keepeth my Works</hi> unto the end, as exegetical of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:33830:78"/>Now theſe works of Chriſt are either ſuch as he commanded, or ſuch as he himſelf practiſed, leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps, perhaps both the one and the other, and both ſtand in direct opoſition to <hi>Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> wicked works, mentioned <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. This <hi>Jezebel</hi> is judged to be ſome great Princeſs, like that <hi>Jezebel</hi> who was the wife of King <hi>Ahab,</hi> mentioned, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. only with this difference, ſhe ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in <hi>Thyatira</hi> pretends to be a Propheteſs, and covers all her Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under that cloak; the other more openly and boldly declared her Sin: Now he that keepeth Chriſt's works in oppoſition to theſe, is he that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh. He that keepeth thoſe works of Purity and Holineſs Chriſt hath commanded, and practiſed for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; (for ſome things he did <hi>qua Deus,</hi> as he was God, which are for our Admiration, not for our Imitation; ſome things he did <hi>qua Mediator,</hi> in dying to reconcile God and man, in which we are not capable to imitate him) <hi>viz.</hi> That Meekneſs and Humility, which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:33830:78"/>he requires us to learn of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies one that is near the ground, thus was Chriſt; in all his Actions he expreſſed great Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and this not ſeemingly only, as the Biſhop that was asked, <hi>Viſne Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopari?</hi> Anſwered, <hi>Nolo.</hi> Modeſtly ſhewing himſelf unwilling, when yet he had uſed all means to obtain it; but really, he declined earthly Promotions and Dignities, out of Humility of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Farther, Chriſt was much in Prayer, which work he did for our Imitation: Upon which one deſcants thus, <hi>Orat is qui non fecit peccatum? ſilet peccator? Orat Medicus? Ceſſat Aegrotus? Orat Judex? Silet Reus?</hi> Oh! Shall he that is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Pray, and the Sinner be ſilent? Shall the Phyſician pray, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be ſilent? Shall the Judge pray, and the Guilty, condemned Malefactor, hold his peace? Again, Chriſt was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate to the Bodies and Souls of Men in Miſery, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.36, 37, 38. He ſet them a praying for Labourers to be ſent into the Harveſt, and he himſelf went up and down Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:33830:79"/>of the Kingdom, and healing Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Diſeaſes: He was very zealous for the Worſhip of God, and againſt Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Innovations, <hi>The zeal of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe did eat him up,</hi> Joh. 2.17, He went through great Sufferings with much Patience; <hi>Oppreſſed and afflicted he was, yet opened not his mouth,</hi> Eſay 53.7. <hi>He was faithful to him that appointed him,</hi> Heb. 3.2. He did heartily and freely forgive the worſt of his Enemies, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> He was much grieved for the ſins of others, and wept over <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Theſe and many more works Chriſt did, that we might tread in his ſteps: A Chriſtian ſhould be, <hi>alter Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> another Chriſt.</p>
            <p>He then that keepeth theſe works of Chriſt as the Apple of his Eye, which the leaſt duſt will offend, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.2. Or as a man keeps his Treaſure, which he locks up in ſafety; or as a man keeps his Life, which he values above the world; or as an honeſt Traveller keeps his way, he would not go out of it willingly; and if he miſtakes, upon knowledg of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:33830:79"/>it is troubled; thankful to him that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informs him, ſpeedily returns into his way, is more circumſpect to prevent wandering for the future, and mends his pace for the time he loſt. He that thus keeps the Works of Chriſt, and that to the end, to the end of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Trial, yea, to the end of his Liſe, this is he that overcometh. That's the firſt.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What is that Power Chriſt here promiſes to give to Overcomers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some think it extends only to the preſent Enemies of this Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> viz. <hi>Jezebel</hi> and her adherents; which although it hath much Comfort in it to the Members of that Church; Yet this Interpretation is too narrow: For the Text ſaies, <hi>He that overcometh, to him will I give Power over the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> a Term of a very large extent. Yea, to ſhew the largeneſs of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it is ſaid to be the like Power to what Chriſt received of his Father. Now God the Father hath given Chriſt. <hi>Power over all fleſh,</hi> Joh. 17.2. And though Believers are not capable of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:33830:80"/>a Power every way equal with what Chriſt hath received; yet ſome ſhare in it or ſhadow of it, is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be given them. Now Chriſt hath received <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which does import Rule and Authority. This is Threefold:</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is, <hi>Poteſtas Diſpoſitiva,</hi> a Right to order and diſpoſe all things and perſons in the Nations; which ſome call a Providential Power: on this account he is ſtiled <hi>King of Nations,</hi> Jer. 10.7. Becauſe he ruleth by his Power for ever, <hi>His eyes behold the Nations,</hi> Pſal. 66.7. He diſpoſeth of his Enemies, <hi>For he hath bought them,</hi> though they deny him, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. He gave the price of his Blood ſufficient for them, and hath Right to diſpoſe of them, and to expect ſervice from them: He hath this Power over his Friends, he hath received Gifts for them, though at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent rebellious; yet he will ſubdue them to himſelf, <hi>that he may dwell in them,</hi> Pſal. 68.18. <hi>Power to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the power of Satan to God,</hi> Act. 26. <hi>He hath the Key
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:33830:80"/>of</hi> David, <hi>he openeth and none can ſhut; and ſhutteth, and none can open,</hi> Rev. 3.7. called <hi>the Key of the houſe of</hi> David, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa. 22.22. that is, of the Church, as ſome interpret. A Similitude taken from thoſe that keep the Keys of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Caſtle, or Pallace, the Gates where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cannot be opened without their leave and Order. Thus Chriſt had opened a Church-door in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> verſ. 8. which no man can ſhut: There was an open door, though many adverſaries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9. He openeth the heart-door alſo, ſo opened he <hi>Lydia</hi>'s heart, <hi>Acts,</hi> 16.14. He openeth the door of faith, as he did to thoſe Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.31. <hi>He openeth the door of hope in the valley of Achor,</hi> Hoſ. 2.15. And makes the Soul that is filled with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deſpairs to evade, to hope againſt hope; He openeth a door of deliverance from the greateſt dangers and extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. A ſhadow of this power is promiſed to Overcomers, for by Faith and Prayer they engage the Power and Providence of Chriſt to work for them: <hi>Jacob</hi> had by prayers and tears, power over the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:33830:81"/>Angel, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, the great Angel of the Covenant, and prevailed; ſo that a ſtrange change was wrought in his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who though he breath'd out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and ſlaughter againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet meeting together, <hi>Eſau</hi> embraced him ſo lovingly, contrary to his expectation, that he accepted it as a plain token of Gods preſence. Hence he ſaith, <hi>I have ſeen thy Face as though I had ſeen the face of God,</hi> Gen. 33.10. In his Brother's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled countenance he ſaw the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous face of God ſmiling upon him: This Victory God granted to <hi>Jacob,</hi> as the fruit of his Wreſtling and Weeping in Prayer, ſuffering himſelf to be overcome by him, and ſubduing his Brother's rage and malice againſt him. <hi>David</hi>'s Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er prevailed with God to defeat <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel</hi>'s evil Couſel, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.31. and 17.23. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Prayer prevailed for the Converſion of many of his Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors: Faithful and fervent Prayers have made wonderful Turns in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World, as might at large be ſhewed. <hi>While</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and believing hand,</hi> Iſrael <hi>prevailed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33830:81"/>againſt</hi> Amalek, Exod. 17.11. <hi>when he let them down,</hi> Amalek <hi>prevailed, and the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>hands were enfeebled:</hi> where we ſee how dangerous it is to faint in Prayer, and how powerful Prayer is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Power of Warlike Enemies. When <hi>Eſther</hi> and her people were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engaged in this work, what a ſtrange Turn was made thereby? A great Turn there was upon the King's heart, he recalls all his Orders granted out for the deſtroying of the Jews, and the whole Plot was turned upon <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s head, who contrived it againſt God's people: This way they have great Power over the Nations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is <hi>Poteſtas Legiſlativa,</hi> a Legiſlative, or Lawgiving Power, which Chriſt hath received of his Father: Thus he is ſtiled <hi>the Judge, the King, the Lawgiver to his people,</hi> Iſa. 33.22. <hi>There is one Lawgiver,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 2.12. <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt. <hi>Lycurgus, Solon,</hi> and others had <hi>Poteſtatem vitae &amp; necis,</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Life and Death; and many now there are who make and give Laws: yet there is but one Supreme and Abſolute
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:33830:82"/>Lawgiver, whoſe Will is the Rule of Juſtice, and this is Chriſt: none can give Laws that directly bind the the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but he; 'Tis true, <hi>We are to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves to every Ordinance of man;</hi> but it is <hi>for the Lord's ſake,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13. 'Tis God's command that lays an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon our Conſciences to obſerve man's; yet withal, if mens Laws be contrary to God's, though we muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto, not reſiſt the Higher Powers, yet active Obedience muſt not be given. <hi>We are to obey God rather than men,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19. For men to impoſe Laws upon the Conſcience, to be obſerved, <hi>ex intuitu voluntatis,</hi> upon the bare ſight of their Will, is to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down in the Throne of God, and ſpeaks the very Spirit of Antichriſt. Now a ſhadow of this Law-giving Power may be given by Chriſt to thoſe that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Enemies, and live in the times of the Churches Exaltation upon the head of them all. When Chriſt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with all Power in Heaven and Earth, he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Go ye and teach all Nations</hi> to obſerve whatſoever
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:33830:82"/>I have commanded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. And when Chriſt ſhall have exalted the Mountain of his Houſe above all the Hills and Mountains of worldly Power and Glory, <hi>then ſhall the Law go forth from</hi> Sion, <hi>and the word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and all Nations ſhall flow unto it.</hi> Behold here a ſhadow of this Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Power given to his Church, even as he received of his Father. All Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall either profeſſionally or really ſtand in an awful reſpect of, and to the Church, and bow to the Laws of Chriſt therein eſtabliſhed: for they primarily receive the Law from Chriſt's mouth, and ſecondarily from the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">There is, <hi>Poteſtas Diſtributiva;</hi> which is a Power to diſtribute Rewards and Puniſhments: This ſome call <hi>a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary Power,</hi> a Power of judging all Nations, giving Eternal Live to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and Eternal Death to all the world beſides. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath cammitted all Judgment to the Son,</hi> Joh. 5.22. Before him ſhall be gathered all Nations, and he ſhall ſeparate them
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:33830:83"/>one from another, <hi>as a Shepherd divides his Sheep from the Goats,</hi> Mat. 24. As many Diviſions as now there are, all will then come under that one Diviſion, either Sheep or Goats, and will have their Judgment paſſed by Chriſt, to whom the Father hath given that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. Such a Power over the Nations is here promiſed to Overcomers; <hi>Know ye not that the Saints ſhall judge the world,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 6.2. Not Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively and principally, not by pronouncing Sentence, this is peculiar to Chriſt; but they ſhall joyn with him in judging them at the Laſt Day, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their conſent unto, and applauding his righteous Sentence. This ſeems here chiefly intended; for it is ſuch a Power, as whereby the Nations are broken, as the veſſels of a Potter are broken to ſhivers; ſo the Text expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: Now earthen Veſſels are eaſily and irrecoverably broken, eſpecially by an Iron Rod. Other Scriptures ſpeak the ſame, <hi>This honour have all his Saints,</hi> ſaies <hi>David, To execute the Judgment written,</hi> Pſal. 149.8. What Judgment,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:33830:83"/>and where written? Some refer it to <hi>Enoch</hi>'s Prophecy, mentioned by St. <hi>Jude v.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten Thouſands of his Saints, to execute judgment upon all,</hi> &amp;c. To adjudge the wicked of the Nations to eternal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. This dominion over the Nations ſhall the upright have in the Morning of the reſurrection, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.14.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>What is that eminent Glory Chriſt here promiſeth to him that Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will give him the Morning-ſtar, ſaies Chriſt. A ſweet and full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; the ſum of it take in the following particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some underſtand it of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is ſtiled <hi>The bright and Morning-ſtar,</hi> Rev. 22.16. Thus he calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: The ſenſe then is, I will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my ſelf wholly to him, and make him conformable to me in glory; Always the proportion of the head and members obſerved: The Morning-ſtar is the moſt bright and ſhining of all the ſtars of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and communicates its light to the world; Chriſt excels all men and Angels,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:33830:84"/>as far as the <hi>Morning-ſtar</hi> all the Stars of Heaven; and he communicates all Light of Grace and Glory to the world of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. He is ſtiled <hi>The Star of</hi> Jacob, Numb. 24.17. this notes his two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. A Star in its Original is from Heaven, which points at his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who is the Lord from Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. yet a Star of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as a man of the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob;</hi> ſo we muſt conceive him, both God and Man: And thus conſidered, He is full of Grace, and of his fulneſs do all Believers receive, <hi>even Grace for Grace.</hi> The <hi>Morning-ſtar</hi> diſpels the Nights darkneſs: When this Day-ſtar ariſes fully in our hearts, all miſts of Ignorance and Errour are diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, wherein we were wrapped in our night of ſin and imperfect condition here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may intimate, that Chriſt will give him that overcomes a glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection at the Laſt-Day. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniel</hi> hints at this, <hi>They that turn many to Righteouſneſs ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament, even as the Stars, for ever and ever,</hi> Dan. 12.3.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33830:84"/>There will not be the ſame meaſure and degree of this; <hi>For as one Star differs from another in Glory, ſo it ſhall be in the Reſurrection,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.41. yet all will be adorned with reſplendent Luſtre and Brightneſs, far exceeding the beauty of the Stars; <hi>For then ſhall the Righteous ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father,</hi> Mat. 13.43. Thoſe that have here lien among the pots ſmutched and ſullied, ſhall then outſhine the Sun in his ſtrength. Shine they ſhall in their Bodies, <hi>which ſhall be conformed to the moſt glorious body of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.21. And in their Souls, thoſe Spirits of juſt men made perfect; and in their whole perſons, as the Spouſe of Chriſt; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xor fulget radiis Mariti;</hi> ſhe ſhall ſhine with the Beams of his Beauty. A glimpſe of this Glory was ſeen in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Face, in Chriſt's Transfiguration, in <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Countenance: But the full manifeſtation thereof is reſerved to the day of the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may imply, That the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comer ſhall have the next degree of Glory to Chriſt, as the Morning-Star is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:33830:85"/>next the Sun; and is called, as ſome think, <hi>The Son of the Morning,</hi> Iſa.. 14.12. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it uſually appears in the Morning, a little before the Sun-riſing; as if it were by the Morning produced. Victorious Souls ſhall be very near to Chriſt in Place and Glory. When one requeſted her two Sons might ſit, the one at Chriſt's right hand, the other at his left, in his Kingdom. He anſwers, <hi>It ſhall be given to them for whom it is prepared of his Father.</hi> Among others, thoſe that have encountred great Troubles, and come off Conquerors, ſhall ſhare in this Honour; For upon this requeſt of the woman, Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Are ye able to drink of the Cup I am to drink of, and to be baptized with the Baptiſm I am to be Baptized with?</hi> Mat. 20.20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Implying, they muſt come under a Baptiſm of Blood and Suffering, that would come to this Honour, to be ſo near to me as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: This honour hath he reſerved to give to him that Overcometh. All the Saints ſhall be with him, but theſe ſo near to him, as the Morning-Star to the Sun.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:33830:85"/>
            <p n="4">4. This Phraſe may alſo intimate, that Chriſt will give the Firſt-fruits of Glory, Foretaſtes of Heaven, even whiles in this world, to aſſure of the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment in another. The Morning-ſtar is, <hi>Anteambulo Solis,</hi> the Suns Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger, and Fore-runner of a perfect Day. Chriſt will give ſuch as overcome Prelibations and Pledges of future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, aſſuring them, <hi>That their path ſhall be as the Light, that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4.18.</p>
            <p>This Morning they will not exchange for the brighteſt Noon-day of worldly Glory, which ends in a Midnight of Trouble and Miſery; but their Morning-Light is in a full Sunſhine of Happineſs. Hence the Saints are ſaid to have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the firſt-fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.23. Though in regard of quantity, the Firſt-fruits under the Law, were but an handful in compariſon of the whole; yet in their ſignification, they were an evidence to them that they ſhould receive a good crop of the reſt: So the Graces and Comforts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God Believers have here, are not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33830:86"/>only ſweet to their apprehenſion for the preſent, but alſo in their reflection as to what is future; they are a pledg of the full Harveſt: Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>The firſt-fruits of them that ſleep,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.20. Becauſe his Reſurrection was a forerunner of the Reſurrection of all his Members; ſo are the firſt fruits of the Spirit here, an aſſurance of a joyful Harveſt of Heavenly Felicity hereafter. The firſt beginnings of Spiritual Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, are an earneſt of the whole crop of Salvation. And as it was ſaid of old, <hi>The Gleanings of</hi> Ephraim <hi>are better than the Vintage of</hi> Abiezer; ſo may I ſay in this matter, The firſt Fruits of Glory Believers receive here, are better than the greateſt harveſt of earthly contentments; becauſe a drop here is a ſure ſign of a River hereafter: the Morning-ſtar a certain forerunner of a glorious conſtellation in Heaven. To all which may be added, that,</p>
            <p n="5">5. This Phraſe implies, that Chriſt will clear the wronged innocency of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: As the Morning-Star brings light after a dark night, ſo after many
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:33830:86"/>falſe accuſations and uncharitable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures paſſed againſt them by the World, and Profeſſors alſo, <hi>God will bring forth their righteouſneſs as the light, and their judgment as the Noon-day,</hi> as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſheweth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.6. As the hope of the Morning-Star to uſher in the day, cauſeth us not to be offended with the darkneſs of the night, ſo ought Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to truſt and wait upon God, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he will clear their cauſe, and reſtore to them their right. When <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar</hi> would encourage <hi>Job</hi> to liſten to his counſel, his agument is, <hi>Thine age ſhall be clearer than the Noon day, thou ſhalt ſhine forth as the morning,</hi> Job 11.17. Thou ſhalt overcome the darkneſs at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent upon thee, thy innocency be revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and comforts renewed. <hi>Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the Morning,</hi> Pſal. 30.5. The morning is, as it were, the reviving time after the death of ſleep, and brings the light, the emblem of joy, after darkneſs; Thus will Chriſt cauſe the light of his peoples Innocency and Uprightneſs to riſe in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, <hi>and their darkneſs to be as the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:33830:87"/>Noon day,</hi> Iſaiah, 58.10. As God can cauſe the Sun of wicked mens honour and proſperity to go down at noon, ſo he can and will cauſe the light of the Saints to riſe at midnight: As <hi>Haman</hi> is a notable example of the firſt, ſo <hi>Joſeph</hi> of the latter: <hi>Hamans</hi> glory and honour how quickly was it obſcured and eclipſed with clouds of diſgrace and ignominy? ſo the falſe accuſations which darkened <hi>Joſephs</hi> reputation vaniſhed as clouds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sun when he goeth forth in his night; There ſhall be a reſurrrection of names, as well as of perſons; <hi>A day when God will make up his jewels,</hi> Mal. 3.17. Then ſhall he take them up out of the dirt of reproaches and ſufferings, and make them clean; ſuch a vindication from all unjuſt imputations and aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as will give them light and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, joy and honour, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 8.16. By theſe things it is evident how eminent the glory is Chriſt promiſes to the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comer, when he ſaith he will give him the morning-ſtar. The Uſe follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Behold here then the miſery of thoſe, who yielding themſelves ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:33830:87"/>to corruption, ſlaves to Satan, and Captives to the world, loſe their part in theſe great promiſes, and the contrary evils are their lot and portion; ſuch are all thoſe who inſtead of keeping Chriſt's works to the end, keep their ſinful and wicked works to the end; hold faſt deceit and hypocriſy to the end, retain their pride and worldlineſs to the end, keep their unclean, drunken, and profane works to the end; being thus entangled and overcome, and ſome after they ſeemed to have eſcaped and got victory over them, yet are again brought into bondage, their latter end will be worſe than their beginning, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. Becauſe they ſin againſt knowledge, and love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil. Theſe may have power over Nations as civil Governours, ſo had <hi>Ahaſuerus, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> and others; <hi>Alexander</hi> called the Conquerour, having ſubdued a great part of the world then inhabited, yet theſe were overcome by their luſts: It was true of them all what was ſaid of the laſt, <hi>vicit mundum, a ſe vero victus;</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:33830:88"/>He conquered the world but was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by himſelf: What could it profit to rule over men a while, and luſts ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led over them, unto their deſtruction? Theſe were alſo overcome by Divine Wrath and Juſtice. All the power men have, and Victories they get over men, will not ſecure them from being broken to ſhivers by Chriſts Iron rod, as a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Veſſel, fatally and irrecoverably ruined: Better is he that by the power of grace ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a City or ruleth over Kingdoms.</p>
            <q>Fortior eſt qui ſe, quam qui fortiſſima vincit Maenia—</q>
            <p>Such may have worldly grandeur, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pomp and Splendour, and ſhine like Stars of the firſt magnitude, yet going on in a ſlate and courſe of ſin, are but <hi>wandering Stars, to whom is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever,</hi> Jude 13. The Angels are ſtiled Morning-ſtars; the Morning-ſtars ſang together, that is, the Angels, as Expoſitors have it; The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels rejoyced to ſee the Foundations of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:33830:88"/>the Earth laid, yet ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Apoſtats, fallen Stars, being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly overcome by ſin. <hi>Satan</hi> is called a fallen Star, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1. We read alſo of a great Star that fell from Heaven, called <hi>Wormwood, Rev.</hi> 8.10, 11. The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, ſay ſome, who ſhined bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a time, but was put down by the <hi>Goths;</hi> of whom the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> thus ſpeaks, <hi>How art thou fallen from Heaven,</hi> O Lucifer, <hi>ſon of the Morning? How art thou cut down to the ground who didſt weaken the Nations?</hi> Iſaiah. 14.12. Sic tranſit glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria mundi; <hi>Though the wicked ſpring as the Graſs, and all the workers of Iniquity do flouriſh, it is that they ſhall be deſtroyed for ever,</hi> Pſal. 92.7. O! who would reſt or glory in outward enjoyments or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, when if the work of Faith and Holineſs be not wrought in us with power, if the Kingdom of God comes not into our ſouls with power, <hi>the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in</hi> Sion <hi>will be afraid, fearfulneſs will ſurprize the Hypocrites, and the cry will be, who among us ſhall dwell with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings? Who ſhall dwell with devouring fire?</hi> Iſaiah 33.14. Thus will
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:33830:89"/>all who are here finally overcome by their yielding themſelves Servants unto Unrighteouſneſs and Iniquity; be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly miſerable, and God juſtified in his proceedings; and his Juſtice and Wrath overcome them, when they are judged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. This gives yet further matter of Comfort to Believers, to meditate upon the Power and Glory here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to him that Overcometh: Here you are many times oppreſſed by the Powers of the Nations, therefore you ſhall have at length full Power over all Nations; Here you endure long and dark Nights of Temptation, Deſertion, and Affliction, yet yielded not to Satan and Sin, therefore the Morning-Star ſhall be given to you; And <hi>when Chriſt who is your life ſhall appear, you alſo ſhall appear with him in Glory,</hi> Col. 3.4. <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is he that hath promiſed, who alſo will do it.</hi> Mens Promiſes fail through want of Fidelity or Ability to perform them; Satan's Promiſes are made to deceive: but the words of Chriſt are true and faithful: He is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who gives a

Let all be perſwaded to wax more valiant in fight, and ſtrive to be Overcomers, that we may inherit the Power and Glory here ſet before us in this Text: What deſperate Deſigns will ſome venture upon in hopes of worldly Power and Glory? Chriſt knowing how tempting and taking theſe are with the Sons of Men, ſets theſe ſuitable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes before them, to animate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to quit themſelves like Men in this holy War, and be ſtrong unto the Battle; and that they who are engaged and have begun well, may not be turned back, and give ground to the Enemy: To this end, could we overcome God, and get his Preſence, Influences, and Aſſiſtances, we ſhould overcome all others with eaſe. <hi>If God be for us,</hi> ſaies St. <hi>Paul, who can be againſt us?</hi> Rom. 8.31. 'Tis true, many are actually againſt us, all the Powers of Hell and Earth; But, <hi>Quis efficaciter?</hi> who can be againſt us to any purpoſe, ſo as to effect their Deſigns againſt us? If God take our part, we ſhall ſee our deſire upon them
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:33830:90"/>that hate us. Now there are two ways men prevail with God; that is, to ſpeak after the manner of men; he yields him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conquered, by the Reflection of their Graces, and the Importunity of their Prayers.
<list>
                  <item>1. By the Reflection of their Graces; <hi>Turn away thine eyes from me,</hi> ſaies Chriſt to his Spouſe, <hi>for they have overcome me,</hi> Cant. 6.4. they have exceedingly wrought and won upon me, like that, Cant. 4.9. <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed my heart, My Siſter, my Spouſe, thou haſt raviſhed mine heart with one of thine eyes; Excordiaſti me,</hi> ſo ſome Gloſs, thou haſt unhearted me, thou haſt taken away my heart from me: An Alluſion to Lovers, who are overcome with the Beauty of thoſe whom they affect.</item>
                  <item>2. By the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of their Prayers; One faith of prayer, <hi>Ligat Omnipotentem, Vincit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibilem:</hi> It overcomes him that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Invincible; as <hi>Moſes, Jacob</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have had Experience; This is the beſt Victory, and the foundation of all other Victories: Make we him our Friend, by the exerciſe of Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and fervent Prayer to him,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33830:90"/>and no matter who be our Enemy: It was once ſaid to <hi>Iſrael, Ye need not fight, for the Lord fighteth for you,</hi> Exod. 14.</item>
               </list> But we are to fight, and not be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by our Adverſaries; <hi>For more are they that are with us, than they that are againſt us,</hi> 2 Kin. 6.16. Let us then prevail with the Almighty, and we are in ſome ſenſe almighty, and ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all in his Strength, and have that Power over the Nations, and the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Star here promiſed to him that Overcometh.</p>

Thus it was here, their works were fair and ſpacious in ſhew, but ſhored up by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity or other low reſpects, and ſo could not with their dead works accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſerve the living God: The taint and infection of Hypocriſy, if predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, is pernicious to all good works; This being their condition, Chriſt gives directions for their cure and recovery; <hi>He calls upon them to be watchful and ſtrive to ſtrengthen that which is ready to dye;</hi> verſe 2. as if he had ſaid, ſome among you have yet ſome good in you, though it be but in a languiſhing condition, in a ſwound and ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: now when perſons are to dye, the watch-candle had not need go out, thoſe about them had need be waking and diligent; ſo when good is declining and dying, then need there is to be watchful, leaſt the little remaining ſpark be quite extinct: To move them to this and other means of recovery, he threatens if they did it not, he would come upon them as a thief, when they were ſecure, unexpectedly, as thieves do
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:33830:92"/>upon men aſleep; and Calamity the more ſudden, the more terrible: partly becauſe it exanimates a man, makes his heart faint and fail, as an unexpected ſtorm doth a Marriner; Partly, becauſe it can as little be prevented as a weak Family can prevent thieves breaking in upon them at unawares: by this he moves them to rouſe up themſelves, and ſhake them out of this ſinful Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> went out and ſhook him, when the Philiſtines were upon him; which if they did not, he would come in an hour when they looked not for him, and take away all their deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enjoyments from them, and leave them ſpoiled and deſtitute: On the other hand, he ſubjoyns a comfortable promiſe to all ſuch as ſhould overcome thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant diſtempers now upon them, which the Text holds forth to them, and to us in them: The ſum of which you have in the Doctrine, which is,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That Overcomers ſhall be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently clothed, their names indelibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, and openly acknowledged, by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Here are three things:</p>
            <pb n="150" facs="tcp:33830:93"/>
            <p n="1">1. Overcomers ſhall be eminently clothed: The ſame ſhall be clothed in white Raiment, ſays Chriſt here; They ſhall not be found naked, being covered with the Covering which is of Gods Spirit, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 30.1. This clothing is no other than Chriſt himſelf, who is the ſpiritual Garment every true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver puts on, according to that exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans, Put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 13.14. A Text by reading and pondering whereof St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſes he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. This <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> does imply <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That Chriſt is the Chriſtians Veſtment, his Spiritual clothing and apparel: The meaning then is, Overcomers ſhall be covered all over with Chriſt: clothed with his Merit and Righteouſneſs, and ſo be juſtified: He is made of God, to ſuch, Righteouſneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. So ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 61.10. he, ſpeaking of God, hath clothed me with the Robe of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he hath put upon me the Garments of Salvation; meaning Chriſt, <hi>ſalvato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem &amp; juſtificatorem noſtrum,</hi> who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:33830:93"/>Believers with his own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as with a precious Robe of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He doth not only redeem them with his Blood, being a Lamb ſlain, <hi>ſed etiam lams operuit,</hi> as one excellently ſaith; He covers them with his Fleece, with his Wool; meaning his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. More particularly, he covers the very Nature; for no created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can behold God; the very <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims</hi> with their Wings cover their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before his glorious Preſence, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.2. much leſs can the Nature of man ſtand before his Majeſty without a Chriſt. He covereth the ſins of all Believers; the loathſom habitual Sore of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deformity: On which account Chriſt ſaith to his Church, <hi>Thou art all fair, my Love, there is no ſpot in thee:</hi> All their Actual Sins alſo, the uglineſs and filthineſs of them is by this covered, together with all the Spots and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of their Holy Duties.</p>
            <p>It's obſervable, That the Mercy-ſeat under the Law covered the two Tables of the Decalogue, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. This Mercy-Seat typified Chriſt, who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:33830:94"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. as the Mercy-Seat is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.5. The Cherubims co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Mercy-Seat, and the Mercy-Seat covered the Ark, in which were the two Tables of the Law: So Chriſt is that Covering-Mercy-Seat that covers all the ſins of Believers againſt the Law of God, ſo that he imputes it not to them: They are likewiſe clothed with the Graces of Chriſt, thoſe Habitual Graces and Vertues in Chriſt are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into them; He was full of Grace, and <hi>of his Fulneſs they all do receive, and Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1.14.16. Their Impatience is clothed with his Patience, their Pride is clothed with his Humility, their Frowardneſs with his Meekneſs, their Ignorance with his Wiſdom and Knowledg, their Unbelief with his Faith, and the like. In a word, He ſo covers them as they are ſecure from thoſe hurts and miſchiefs that otherwiſe they lye open to: They are ſecured from Divine Wrath and Vengeance; which elſe they can no more avoid, than a naked man can fence off Fire; Chriſt and his Graces are the Skreen between
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:33830:94"/>them and everlaſting Burnings. They are by this alſo ſecured from Satan's aſſaults, to whoſe fiery darts they are liable to be expoſed, having no other way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the deſtroying dint and power of them, but to be covered with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Light and Righteouſneſs; this put on by Faith, quencheth <hi>the fiery darts of that wicked one,</hi> Epheſ. 6.16. Secured they are alſo from the terrible ſtings and laſhes of an accuſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: By his Blood their hearts are ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. As our bodily Garments are, <hi>Munimenta corporis,</hi> a kind of a moveable Garriſon, as one ſtiles them, in which the Body marches and is defended from many Inconveniences; ſo is Chriſt to the Souls of all that Overcome. The ſum of this Promiſe then amounts to this in the General; That Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs ſhall be effectually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to their particular perſons. The clothing of the Body is the application of Apparel to the Body; ſo Chriſt is and ſhall be appropriated and applied to Believers, whereby they ſhall be as
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:33830:95"/>fully poſſeſs'd of him, as a man is of the Garments with which he is clothed; they ſhall have him as their own, to all holy and good ends appointed. It's a thing of high moment, conſidering (as hath been hinted) how he is fitted every way to our condition. As there muſt be a fitneſs between the Clothes, and the perſon who is to wear them; ſo there is in this caſe. An High-Prieſt he is, and ſuch as became us, as is ſuited and fitted to our circumſtances; we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Wrath, he is our Peace; we unjuſt, he Righteous; we dead, he is Life; we poor, he is Rich; we deformed, he Lovely; we filthy, he Holy: With this clothing are Overcomers inveſted, and continue ever thus clothed. As the putting off the old man is ſo done, as they never put him on again; ſo the putting on Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and Graces is ſo done, as they never put it off more, but ſtand before God in this clothing to all Eternity. And that we may yet a little further ſee and be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the ſweetneſs of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall be clothed with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:33830:95"/>white Raiment;</hi> which notes Purity, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity, Beauty and Feſtivity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It notes Purity; White Garments are clean, free from Pollution and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement. We read of <hi>Joſhua</hi> having fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Garments upon him, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.3. The tattered Rags of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> the naſty Filthineſs and ſuperfluity of Naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs that yet remained in him, (though in part regenerate) and intermingled with his beſt works. Should God break open that filthy ſink of Sin that is in the beſt of us, we ſhould not only be loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to God and to men, but to our ſelves alſo. I have read of one Mr. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> who deſired of God he might ſee his utmoſt uncleanneſs, who gave him his requeſt: He ſaw his Sins in ſuch ugly colours, as cauſed him to go down Mourning to his grave. Now <hi>Joſhua</hi> found Grace in the Lord's ſight, and had his filthy garments taken away from him, and was cloathed with change of Raiment, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. His rags were changed into Robes, his polluted garments into clean Clothing: He was arrayed with that fine and clean Linnen, <hi>which is the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:33830:96"/>Righteouſneſs of Saints,</hi> Rev. 19.8. Thus the Lord takes upon him their ſin, and puts on them his pure and ſpotleſs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. A bleſſed exchange indeed! Chriſt puts upon Overcomers his own Comlineſs, decks them with his own Purity, to take away all their Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It notes Dignity and Honour: In old time when Men were dignified for any Service done to their Prince, they were clothed with the White Raiment; Thus when <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> the King would put Honour upon <hi>Mordecai,</hi> he cauſed him to be clothed with a Garment of Royal Apparel, <hi>White and Blue,</hi> Eſth. 8 15. ſuch as Kings and great Ones uſed to wear: <hi>What ſhall be done to the man,</hi> ſaies the forenamed King to: <hi>Haman, that the King delights to honour?</hi> Who anſwereth thus, <hi>Let the Royal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel be brought that the King uſeth to wear, that they may array that man withal,</hi> Eſth. 6.6, 7, 8, 9. As if he had ſaid, Let the Keepers of the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe bring forth the Kings moſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Apparel, that he uſeth to wear
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:33830:96"/>when he ſitteth in State, and put it upon him in the beſt manner they can. Thus ſhall he that Overcometh be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raied with Honourable Clothing, like the Favoutites, yea the Children of the King of Kings; The Everlaſting Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, a Garment ſo Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable as never yet came upon the back of an Angel: <hi>Such honour have all his Saints,</hi> to ſtand before him in this Noble Clothing, peculiar to them in the Houſe and Family of this great King of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It intimates Beauty and Glory; This is alſo ſet out by the colour of white; ſo when Chriſt was transfigured on the Mount, <hi>his face did ſhine as the ſun, and his raiment was white as the light,</hi> that is, it ſhined with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſplendour and brightneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.2. We find the countenance of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.3. <hi>to be like lightning, and his raiment white as ſnow;</hi> and two other (called men, appearing in humane ſhape) in white apparel, that is, very glorious and beautiful, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.10. Thus Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers ſhall be clothed in white Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:33830:97"/>
               <hi>they ſhall walk with me in white;</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4. in great Beauty and Glory: <hi>The Kings Daughter is all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious within, her clothing is of wrought gold,</hi> Pſal. 45.10. Yea, they are ſaid to be <hi>clothed with the ſun, Rev.</hi> 12.1. Cloth of Gold is accounted very glorious, but if a man were clothed with the natural Sun, he would be much more bright and beautiful. How renowned for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are they then who are clothed with the Sun of Righteouſneſs? Some who have no natural beauty, yet appear amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by their fine ſhining Garments; They are for Ornament, and are to the Body as rich Hangings or coſtly Varniſh over a wall of Clay, which make it look better than elſe it would; as the Poet ſaith, <hi>Viro veſtis magnum decus addit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſta;</hi> Such a garment is Chriſt, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorns the Soul, and gives it a rich and perfect beauty; He is ſet out by <hi>the wedding-garment,</hi> Mar. 22.12. The High Prieſts garments of old were but types of this, which were made for beauty and glory, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.2. All the comlineſs of the Saints, is by reaſon of this beautiful
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:33830:97"/>dreſs in which they are attired: This is that Raiment of Needle-work which is a great Ornament to them, though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in rags or mean clothing. He is a Crown and Diadem upon the head; Signified by that fair Miter which was ſet upon <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s head, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.5. which hath its name from compaſſing about, becauſe it invironed the High Prieſts head. It had a holy Crown with it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.6. ſignifying the Deity and Dignity of Chriſt. It had alſo upon the forefront of it a plate of pure gold with this engraving, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord;</hi> who is ſaid to be glorious in Holineſs. All ſhews what excellent beauty and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is put upon the Overcomer clothed with this white Raiment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It ſignifies feſtivity and rejoycing; Black is the mourning colour, white is the colour of delight and joy: They uſed white Garments at Feaſts and joyful Solemnities: Hence that of <hi>Solomon, Let thy garments be always white,</hi> Eccl. 9.8. Not abſolutely, but in all proper ſeaſons of rejoycing. The very beaſts on which they rode in triumph to praiſe the Lord
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:33830:98"/>for victory over their Enemies were of this colour; They rode on white Aſſes, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.10. That great mercy of Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is ſet out to us under the notion of a <hi>white ſtone, Rev.</hi> 2.17. To ſignify what ground of ſpiritual joy they have whoſe ſin is pardoned. The ſenſe then is, <hi>Overcomers ſhall be filled with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. Glorious, becauſe this joy is a taſte of future Glory, or elſe becauſe it made them glorious in the eyes of men: <hi>The Kingdom of God is joy in the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14.17. When they are worſted by their Enemies, they are filled with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs; but if at any time they lead captivity captive, and can get their feet upon the neck of thoſe that hate them, then their ſorrow is turned into joy, and their joy ſhall no man take away from them. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> (or rather God for <hi>Iſrael</hi>) overcame <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſts, <hi>Then ſang</hi> Iſrael <hi>a joyful ſong unto the Lord, Exod.</hi> 15. Thus ſhall all victorious Souls have their mouths filled with laughter, and their tongues with ſinging, and ſay, The Lord hath done great things for us,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:33830:98"/>whereof we are glad; Great is the ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rejoycing of Soldiers when they get a Victory, and with much better joy ſhall they be clothed and filled, who conquer in this holy war. This is the firſt thing here promiſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Rea.</hi> Overcomers names are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly recorded by Jeſus Chriſt; who here aſſures them of it, ſaying, <hi>I will not blot out his Name out of the Book of Life.</hi> A Metaphorical expreſſion alſo; we read of the book of Scripture, the book of Nature, the book of Conſcience, and here and in other places of the book of Life, and that the names of men are written there, and thoſe once engraven never ſhall be obliterated, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. There we find the Lambs book of Life, wherein are names written from the foundation of the world; The phraſe is taken from the enrolling of Citizens and Soldiers, that they may be known to be ſuch. The promiſe implies, That Overcomers are dear and precious in the eyes of Chriſt; It is in matters of ſome concernment that things are committed to writing, which men will carefully
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33830:99"/>keep, that nothing be expunged or blotted out: This is ſeen in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and others, who cauſed Writings to be drawn and preſerved upon weighty oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Chriſt hath an high eſteem of Valiant and Conquering Chriſtians, they are written before him; yea, they are written within him, engraven in his Knowledg and Remembrance, and in his Love and Affections, as very dear unto him. As the Names of the Tribes were written upon Stones, which the High-Prieſt bare on his Breaſt-plate, when he went into the moſt holy Place: Even ſo the names of all Believers are written upon the heart of Chriſt, to ſhew how precious they are to him. Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> ſaid, <hi>If ſhe were opened after her Death, they ſhould find</hi> Calice <hi>written in her heart.</hi> Were Faith duely exerciſed, we might ſee Believers engraven upon Chriſt's heart; and this Book ſhall never admit one of the Names in it to be croſſed out. If a <hi>Pilate</hi> could ſay, <hi>Quod ſcripſi, ſcripſi;</hi> What I have written, I have written: Chriſt much more. There are no <hi>Errata,</hi> and therefore no <hi>Delea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:33830:99"/>in the Book of Life. And who ſhould blot them out? Not Men or Angels, for it is a Sealed Book to them; not their Sins, (which yet they fear more than the former) for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are blotted out by the hand of Free-Grace; <hi>I, even I, am he, that blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out thy Tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake,</hi> Iſa. 43.25. As a Creditor takes his Pen and blots out the Debt, or as men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel Bills of Indictment, ſo doth God (to ſpeak of him after the manner of men) dip his pen in the Blood of his Son, and daſhes out the Hand-writings againſt them, and cancels all thoſe large Bills: And this not as men blot things out that are written upon Paper, where great blurs remain, and they may poſſibly be read again; <hi>but as a Cloud, as a thick Cloud,</hi> Iſa. 44.22. The Sun ſo ſcatters and blots out the Clouds, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them to be ſeen; their ſins are ſo done away, as not to he remembred any more; are as if they had never been. As a Table-Book, waſh it, and there is no appearance of any thing written there; ſo hath the Lord removed their
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:33830:100"/>Iniquities: and having blotted out their ſins for his Name's ſake, will not blot out their Names for their ſins ſake. So then it remains, that none but Chriſt can blot out their Names; for he is the Maſter of the Rolls, and keeps this Book in his own poſſeſſion, and he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all fears of it, by his own ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Promiſe in the Text.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Againſt this ſome object theſe two Scriptures,</hi> Exod. 32.32, 33. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, Blot me out of thy Book. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath ſinned againſt me,</hi> ſaies God, <hi>him will I blot out of my Book: eſpecially that, Rev.</hi> 22.19. It any man ſhall take away from the words of the Book of this Prophecy, God ſhall take away his part out of the Book of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As for that place in <hi>Exodus,</hi> ſome carry it, as if <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired in the former verſe to loſe his part in a better Life than is here to be enjoyed, even Eternal Life, rather than God be thus diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and blaſphemed; but think it a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſire, or great zeal at the beſt with a mixture of corrupt paſſion in it: But others underſtand it of the Book of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:33830:100"/>in which mens names were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred. Princes uſe to keep ſuch Books, in which were ſet. down the Names of thoſe that had done them any ſpecial Service: <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s name was recorded in ſuch a Book, and how he acted to preſerve the King's Life, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 6. And this was much Self-denial in <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be willing to have his Name razed out thence for the Peoples good. <hi>Moſes</hi> rather deſired not to live, than that all the people involved in that ſin ſhould dye; willing to have his Name blotted out of the Church Records, than the people come under this great Judgment. Like that wiſh of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 9.3. who wiſhed himſelf <hi>accurſed from Chriſt, for</hi> his <hi>Brethren and Kinſmen according to the fleſh.</hi> Some ſay, Such was his Love to his Kindred, that if it had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Will of God, he deſired to have redeemed the caſting away of the Iſraelites, with the loſs of his own Soul for ever: But beſides that, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was impoſſible to be accompli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hed, it would have been ſinful. By this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or being Accurſed from Chriſt,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:33830:101"/>he means only to be Excommunicated from the Church, which is called Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. Which argued a high Affection to his Relations. And as to the other place, <hi>God's taking away their part out of the Book of Life,</hi> is no more than to manifeſt they have no part therein; and hence we find the Scripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſome, <hi>Whoſe Names were not written in the Lambs Book of Life from the Foundation of the world,</hi> Rev. 13.8. God will declare them to be ſuch, as were not Predeſtinated from all Eternity to be ſaved by the Death of Chriſt. Some there are not written in this Book; but none written there ſhall be blotted out. That's the Second Particular.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Rea.</hi> Chriſt will confeſs the names of Overcomers before his Father, and before his Angels; as if he had ſaid, I will own and acknowledg him, as he hath owned and acknowledged me: They have confeſſed him before men, and he hath promiſed to confeſs ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.32. The meaning is, that Chriſt will publickly own them in the great Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:33830:101"/>and will openly profeſs their well-tried Faith and other victorious Graces, and they ſhall be <hi>found to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Praiſe, and Glory at his appearing,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. Then he will avouch them to be his Children, ſaying, <hi>Father, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I and the Children which thou haſt given me,</hi> Iſa. 8.18. <hi>Eſther,</hi> though ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to Honour with the King, own'd her Relation to <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and told him what he was unto her, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> though advanced to great Dignity and a chief Favourite in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, yet owned and confeſſed his poor Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even before the King and his Courtiers, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. Even ſo will Chriſt at that day own his victorious Servants and Soldiers before the King of Kings, and all thoſe glorious Courtiers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the holy Angels. A taſte of this he gave, when he was here on Earth; When ſome told him, his Relations ſtood without deſiring to ſpeak with him, he pointed to his Diſciples, and ſaid, <hi>Behold my Mother, and my Brethren: For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven, the ſame is my Mother, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:33830:102"/>Siſter, and Brother,</hi> Mat. 12.49, 50. Here he freely owns and confeſſes his Spiritual Kindred, and prefers them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his bare natural Relations.</p>
            <p>So we find him making a report of their excellency who were his Diſciples unto God his Father, ſaying, <hi>I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted thy Name to the men whom thou gaveſt me out of the world, and they have kept thy word,</hi> Joh. 17.6. Here he makes an honourable mention of their laying up his words in their hearts, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it in their lives: And though as yet they were but weak, yet he doth notably commend their good beginnings to his Father. What will he do then at laſt, when they ſhall have perfectly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome? We find it recorded of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, that he confeſſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied not, but confeſſed, <hi>I am not the Chriſt;</hi> and after owned him and pointed at him, ſaying, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi> verſ. 29. <hi>John</hi> is plain and bold, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and conſtant in his teſtimony of Chriſt, renonuncing the honour due to his Maſter, and confeſſing and declaring Chriſt in the dignity and excellency of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:33830:102"/>his Office, ſhewing them how he was to execute the ſame for their good and benefit; which was by Suffering; and therefore points him out as the ſubſtance of the Paſſover, and daily Sacrifices who by the Merit and Vertue of his Death takes away the ſin of his own, both Jews and Gentiles. And did <hi>John</hi> loſe by this his reſolute Confeſſion? No, not even here; for Chriſt did as freely confeſs, and make an honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>among them that are born of women, there hath not riſen a greater than</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt,</hi> Mat. 11.11. Becauſe he was Chriſt's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Forerunner; now the nearer to Chriſt, the more excellent. He prefers him not only before all the Prophets, but all others that were born before him. This is but the beginning of what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſhall be more fully made of the Names of all that overcome in the great day of the Lords coming to Judgment. The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> follow:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. See hence the miſerable eſtate of all who overcome not, but are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and finally overcome in their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:33830:103"/>againſt theſe enemies of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: They have neither part nor lot in theſe precious Promiſes; yea, the quite contrary things will be their Portion. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being clothed in white raiment, in token of Purity, Dignity, Beauty and Feſtivity, they will at laſt appear in all their filthy Rags and menſtruous Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; clothed with Shame, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with confuſion of Face. <hi>His ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> ſaith God of <hi>David, will I clothe with ſhame,</hi> Pſal. 132.18. Much more thoſe that dye in their enmity to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Their Names are written in the Earth, and will be <hi>blotted out from under Heaven,</hi> Deut. 29.20. They ſhall not be written among the living in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> but regiſtred among the dead, as thoſe that are Eternally forgotten of God. Inſtead of confeſſing him, he will profeſs, <hi>He never knew them,</hi> Mat. 7.23. He will be aſhamed of them before his Father, and before all his Angels, as they were of him, and of his words before men, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. A Figurative Speech, and ſpoken of Chriſt, after the manner of men, for our capacity: Not that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:33830:103"/>Chriſt ſhall then be ſubject to any ſhame, or be affected with it; but that he ſhall ſo carry himſelf towards ſuch as have been aſhamed of him, aſhamed to own his Truth, and engage to fight in his Cauſe, as men are wont to do towards thoſe of whoſe company and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance they are aſhamed; that is to ſay, That he will not acknowledg them for his Saints, Servants, or Soldiers; but utterly refuſe, reject, and caſt them off, as wicked and reprobate. They who now deny to fight under his Banner, or profeſſing ſo to do, ſhall yield to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, be overcome and recover not, riſe not by true Repentance, theſe will Chriſt deny before his Father, and before all Men and Angels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Here is yet further Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to all to ſtrive to Overcome: Whoſe heart can ſink into diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? whoſe Faith can fail, that reads and duely conſiders the ſweet Cordials in this Text? <hi>You ſhall be clothed with white Raiment,</hi> by Chriſt's own hand it ſhall be put upon you: White inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as well as outwardly. Not like the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:33830:104"/>
               <hi>Phariſees,</hi> whited Sepulchres, outwardly beautiful, but within full of rottenneſs and dead mens bones; but as the King's Daughter, <hi>All glorious within,</hi> Pſal. 45. Solomon <hi>in all his glory was not arrayed like a Lily of the field,</hi> Mat. 6.29. The moſt ſplendid and gorgeous Robes of the greateſt Monarch, are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto this clothing. This is the beſt Robe, ſpoken of, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. which the Father commanded to be brought forth, and put upon his returning Son; who by Repentance and converting Grace overcame all his former vicious and evil Converſation: This is durable Raiment. God did miraculouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Garments of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from waxing old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.4. But they were otherwiſe the worſe for the wearing, as we ſay of all other Garments. But this clothing waxeth not old, is as freſh upon the Overcomer, after he hath worn it Thouſands of Years, as it was the firſt day it was put put upon him. <hi>The rich man,</hi> we read of in the Goſpel, <hi>was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with Purple,</hi> Luke 16.19. But O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomers with Cloth of Gold. <hi>Her
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:33830:104"/>clothing is of wrought Gold,</hi> Pſal. 45.13. Yea, far more precious than Gold that periſhes. He that yields to his Luſts and other Enemies, rejects this raiment; and does like him we read of, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.27. that wore no clothes, and would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer none to be put upon him. Is it not great encouragement then that is here promiſed, that none ſhall be ſo well arraid as the Overcomer? When that man was cured of his Madneſs, he ſate at Jeſus feet clothed and in his right mind, <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. None come rightly to themſelves but will fight couragiouſly, and ſtrive to be victorious, ſince their Rags and poor Apparel here they many times wear, ſhall be converted into ſuch rich clothing. And ſo, what a ſweet Promiſe is it that follows? <hi>I will not blot out his name out of the Book of Life.</hi> When ſome came to Chriſt, rejoycing that they wrought Miracles, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly caſt out Devils in his Name, he corrects them as miſtaking the true ground of Joy, and points them to the right, <hi>Rejoyce not in this that, the Spirits are ſubject to you; but rather rejoyce in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:33830:105"/>this, that your Names are written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Luk. 10.20. out of the reach of all your Enemies, they can never caſt a blot upon them. Here they blot them with Reproaches, and vile Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Miſtreſs did him: Here they blot out, excommonucate and caſt out their Names as vile and odious; but ſtill they remain written in Heaven, and ſhall be had in everlaſting Remembrance. So to be confeſſed by Chriſt at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, Angels and Men, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall be diſcarded with a <hi>Diſcedite a me, neſcio vos;</hi> Depart from me, I know you not. What Favour and Comfort will it give Overcomers? Having therefore theſe Promiſes, let nothing daunt or diſmay us; nothing is more unbeſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Royal Spirit of a Chriſtian. Say not, the Devil is ſo malicious, the World ſo enſnaring, the Heart ſo deceitful, our Attempts againſt them ſo fruitleſs, we ſhall one day periſh by our Enemies hand. Is this the language of Heaven? Are theſe the words of Faith? Is this the voice of the Scripture, and not rather the whiſperings of the Old Serpent?
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:33830:105"/>The fruit of ſlaviſh Fear and Unbelief? Is not the voice of God quite contrary? Doth not he ſay, I will pour clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean; from all your Iniquities and from all your I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols I will cleanſe you? <hi>The God of Peace ſhall tread down Sathan under your feet ſhortly,</hi> Rom. 16.20. <hi>That whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is born of God, overcometh the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4. Has he ſaid it, and ſhall it not come to paſs? Is not he faithful that hath promiſed? Why then ſhould we be faint-hearted? Why ſhould we ſuffer our Fears to diſanimate and diſpirit us? Let us not be like thoſe unbelieving ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Spies, who ſaid, Canaan <hi>was a good Land, but there were</hi> Anakims, <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants;</hi> and by bringing an evil report, diſheartned the people, and were ſhut out by God, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6. But let us all beg a <hi>Caleb</hi>-like Spirit, whereby we may <hi>follow God fully,</hi> as he did, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.24. and our Enemies ſhall not ſtand before us. Give a Soldier Courage, and you give him all; But take away his Heart, and then he is almoſt dead before he ſtrike a ſtroak: It is a Seal to his Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:33830:106"/>and a great advantage to the Enemy: This evil of Unbelief and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs of Spirit, doth us more hurt than all our Enemies can do. When <hi>Saul</hi> was afraid, he had not a heart to ſtrike a ſtroke, but went to the Witch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 28.4, 5. Were we valiant to the Battle, God would ſay as he did of old to <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Iſrael, Your enemies ſhall not be able to ſtand before you:</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve therefore the language of their enemies, <hi>I know the Lord will give you the Land, for your terrour is fallen upon us,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and all the Inhabitants of the Land faint becauſe of you. Aſſoon as we heard theſe things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in any man, becauſe of you,</hi> Joſh. 2.9-11. We cannot pleaſe the Enemies better, than to ſay, We ſhall never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them; for then they pluck up their Spirits, and hope the day ſhall be theirs: and God is much diſpleaſed; and what if he ſhould ſay, It ſhall be as we ſpeak, we ſhall never get Victory? Oh! Let us not provoke him to leave us to the power of our Adverſaries. Chriſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:33830:106"/>was wont to ſay, <hi>According to your Faith, ſo be it unto you:</hi> And he is of the ſame mind ſtill. Oh provoke him not to ſay, According to your Fears, according to your Unbelief, ſo be it unto you: Only <hi>believe,</hi> and we ſhall ſee the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Martha, Joh.</hi> 11.40. Lift up your hands that hang down, and your feeble knees, and know that the Battle is not to the ſtrong. Though the Enemy be ſtrong and you weak, yet exerciſe but Faith upon the Mighty God, and the day is yours. The Difficulties and Dangers ſhould rather animate, and raiſe the Spirit and Faith of a Chriſtian, than diſcourage. <hi>Alexander,</hi> in a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, would ſay, <hi>Hoc eſt periculum par animo</hi> Alexandri; Here's a danger, or a difficulty, fit for the Spirit and Courage of <hi>Alexander</hi> to encounter with. Have not Chriſtians reaſon then to be coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, and when great and hard Service appears, and called to engage in the heat of the Battle, to ſay, Here is a piece of Service fit for Believers to go
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33830:107"/>through? Theſe are Dangers and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties for true Chriſtians, who go out againſt the Enemy, as <hi>David</hi> did againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> in the Name and Strength of the Lord: Be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might, and the Victory is yours. Methinks Believers ſhould do as of old <hi>Eleazar</hi> did, who fought till his hand clave unto his Sword, <hi>and the Lord wrought a great Victory that day,</hi> 2 Sam 23.9, 10. Let not Faith be aſleep in a dead Habit; a Giant may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come aſleep: <hi>Sampſon</hi> was conquered by the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> being aſleep on <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilahs</hi> Lap. Sin and Satan get great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages upon ſecure Souls. Let none be diſcouraged, ſaying, The Enemy riſe afreſh upon us; let us look to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation for a freſh Supply of his Spirit, and we ſhall prevail. I conclude with <hi>Joab</hi>'s encouraging words to his Soldiers, <hi>Be of good Courage, and let us play the men for our People, and for the Cities of our God, and let the Lord do that which ſeemeth him good,</hi> 2 Sam. 10.12. So I ſay, Let us be of good Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:33830:107"/>in this Cauſe of God and our Souls, and leave the iſſue unto God, who will bring us off Conquerors, and cauſe us to inherit the good of theſe Promiſes in the Text.</p>

            <p>EVery Promiſe is a Breaſt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, from whence the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt may draw freſh Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiliaries in all their faintings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:33830:108"/>ſuch ſupplies of ſtrength and life, as will revive their weak and weary ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as will recruit and renew their ſouls unto the holy War, in which they are engaged. The holy Scriptures are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk, but the Promiſes are <hi>flos lactis,</hi> as one ſaith, the cream, the pureſt of all. There is a ſtory of a fight between <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> and <hi>Terrae-filius,</hi> who ſought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy each other: This <hi>Terrae-filius,</hi> when he was faint and weary, would caſt himſelf down upon the Earth, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lain a little while, recovered and was freſh for the combate, and ſo Overcame his Enemy, A humble reliance upon, a believing improvement of the Promiſes, is a ſingular way of renewing ſtrength, a never-failing means of Victory over our Spiritual Adverſaries. As God gives us in his word Line upon Line, Precept up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Precept, ſo here he ſets down Promiſe upon Promiſe for our encouragement, to go on fighting till he bring forth Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto Victory. Five of thoſe we have already ſpoken ſomthing to: Behold here another preſented to our Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in this Text; It is firſtly directed
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:33830:109"/>to the Church in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> a City in <hi>Lydia,</hi> or in <hi>Myſia</hi> or <hi>Eolia,</hi> ſeated in a dangerous place, therefore not populous; yet a Church planted there, and very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. It is obſerved, that <hi>Smyrna</hi> and this <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> were the only Churches of all the ſeven, which Chriſt records no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt; as <hi>Laodicea</hi> was the only Church of the ſeven which he mentions nothing commendable in. Concerning this of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Chriſt gives teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the preſent good that was in her, verſ. 8. <hi>I know thy works; thou haſt kept my Word, and haſt not denied my Name.</hi> By the word and name of Chriſt, we are to underſtand that whole Truth whereby God in Chriſt had revealed himſelf and his Will to his Church; Soundneſs of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Purity of Worſhip, and Holineſs of Converſation, were the things ſhe held faſt; After this, he gives her aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Goodneſs and Mercy ſhould follow her, verſ. 9.10. <hi>Behold, I will make them that are of the Synagogue of Satan to come and worſhip before thee,</hi> &amp;c. I will make them reverence thee as one belov'd of me, I will both ſubdue thy diſguiſed
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:33830:109"/>Adverſaries, and preſerve thee under all thoſe trials which are coming upon the world. Then he proceeds to exhort unto duty, <hi>To Hold faſt that, which ſhe had;</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <item>3. Chriſt uſeth further ſweet Promiſes of high and glorious things to all that perſeveringly overcome,

            <p>Doct. <hi>Overcomers ſhall be made Pillars in the Temple of God, that ſhall go no more out, and excellent Names ſhall be written upon them, by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> For thus he himſelf promiſeth to do, here in theſe words. To open this in two <hi>Branches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bran. 1. <hi>Chriſt will make Overcomers Pillars in his Houſe that ſhall go no more out:</hi> Three things ſeem chiefly intended in this Promiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Stability, Beauty, and Perpetuity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Stability;</hi> This is promiſed in this Phraſe, <hi>I will make him a Pillar in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of my God;</hi> It is by Expoſitors taken to be an Alluſion to the Pillars that were erected in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple; the one was called <hi>Jachin,</hi> which ſignifies he ſhall eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh; the other <hi>Boaz,</hi> that is in it is ſtrength, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7.21. Both amount to this, Firmneſs and Stability. Some think that the infinite Power of Chriſt is aimed at in theſe Pillars: it ſtill confirms this matter; Overcomers ſhall be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the Houſe of God by the Power of Chriſt himſelf; <hi>Him will I make a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:33830:110"/>ſaies he in the Text. It is a great Favour to have a Nail in his Temple, a Name, a Room in his Houſe and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; though we be but weak Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but bruiſed Reeds. To have Truth, though with much Infirmity and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is to be eſteemed an ineſtimable Mercy; but to be Pillars there, is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Priviledge: To be ſettled and roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, confirmed and eſtabliſhed there, is a very deſirable Bleſſing and very great Honour. Such Honour is here made the Portion of Overcomers.</p>
            <p>We read of <hi>Jacob ſetting up a Pillar of Stone,</hi> Gen. 35. and of the Promiſe of God to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> (being to go on his Errand to a furious and oppoſing Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Prophet timerous) <hi>I will make thee an Iron Pillar,</hi> Jer. 1.18. Stone and Iron both are very ſtrong. To be a Living Stone in God's Houſe is a great Mercy; but to be a Pillar of Stone, or of Iron, notes Spiritual and Divine Strength given to ſuch, that they ſtand firm and upright, and are Inſtrumental to bear up the Name, Truth and Intereſt of God in the world.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:33830:111"/>Hence is the Church ſtiled, <hi>The pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. Not as if the Church were the Foundation of the Truth, as the Papiſts ſay; (for indeed the Truth is the Foundation of the Church: That's the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue Church which is <hi>built upon the Foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles,</hi> (not upon their Perſons, but upon their Doctrines) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner Stone,</hi> Epheſ. 2.20.) But as the Pillar Bears up the King's Proclamation, that it may be viſible and legible, ſo is the Church the Pillar of Truth; it holds forth the Truth of God to the view of all that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it: And keeps up the Doctrine, and Worſhip of the Goſpel from falling; or elſe in an ordinary way Truth would be born down by Errour, and Purity of Adminiſtration in Divine Worſhip would be caſt down by Idolatrous and Superſtitious Innovations. It is a great Mercy, when there are Breaches and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in a Land, to heal them by juſt Government: And when Righteouſneſs is falling, and Equity can ſcarce enter in a Nation, but all through Injuſtice and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:33830:111"/>Oppreſſion ready to run to ruine and confuſion, <hi>To bear up the Pillars of the Earth, even when it and its Inhabitants are diſſolved,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, Pſal. 75.3. And it is no leſs Favour to be ſettled Pillars in the Temple of God, to keep up and to maintain his Intereſt in the world. We read that <hi>Abſolom in his life time reared up for himſelf a Pillar, having no Son, to keep his Name in remembrance,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.18. God rears up to himſelf Spiritual Pillars to keep up the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of his Name in the world, which elſe would ſoon be forgotten among men. And how great the Bleſſing is to be ſuch a Pillar, who can declare? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability darkens a mans excellency; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtable as water, thou ſhalt not excel,</hi> was <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſaying to <hi>Reuben,</hi> Gen. 49.4. Water is eaſily moved by the Wind every way; He being thus unſettled, did not excel, either in the number of his Tribe, or Valour, or any excellent Atchievement. To be a Reed ſhaken with every wind of Doctrine, is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable. To ſeem to be Pillars, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did, and yet not to walk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:33830:112"/>right foot, as he is charged to do, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9, 14. is very unbecoming: But to be ſo indeed, to be fixt and grounded in the Faith and Order of the Goſpel, to be rooted and confirmed in the Temple of God, is a Mercy promiſed only <hi>To him that Overcometh;</hi> to ſhew in what eſteem ſuch are with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Beauty</hi> is here alſo ſignified in this Expreſſion: Pillars are not only the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, (as I may ſay) but the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not the Strength only, but the Glory of a Building; eſpecially in ſuch large and long Structures, where there are many, and rows of them, as in the Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7, 3. So then the ſenſe is, Overcomers ſhall be made by Chriſt the Glory of his Church, the Beauty of his Temple. In the Chariot <hi>Solomon</hi> made for himſelf, <hi>the Pillars were of Silver,</hi> Cant. 3.10. Some take it for the Graces of the Spirit of God; others underſtand it of the Miniſters of the Church, named <hi>Pillars</hi> in <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. fore-mentioned: Others to note thoſe of eminency in the Church, who labour to uphold and ſupport the truth of Chriſt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:33830:112"/>therein, to be the Silver Pillars, to be the Beauty of the Church; yea, the Glory of Chriſt, as ſome are ſaid to be, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. Silver when purified is very beautiful; Victorious Chriſtians are Silver Pillars, an excellent glory in the Temple of God. <hi>Wiſdome hath builded her Houſe, ſhe hath hewen her out ſeven Pillars,</hi> Prov. 9.1, 2. Chriſt is here meant by Wiſdome; And though ſome take the Houſe he hath built, to be the World, and it is a truth, that Chriſt built this great Houſe and Fabrick of the Univerſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.4. Yet moſt carry it to be the Church, that Spiritual Houſe which he is here ſaid to build. But what the ſeven Pillars are, is not agreed on: Some take the Seven Liberal Arts to be they; Others, the ſeven Days of the Week; Others, the ſeven Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, mentioned <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2. And ſome, (which is to the matter now before us) for a competent number of Faithful Perſons, who by their ſtedfaſt adhering to Chriſt and his Truth, not only ſupport, but adorn and beautifie his Church. As thoſe who through
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:33830:113"/>Cowardiſe and ſlaviſh Fear yield to the Enemy, are a Diſgrace and Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo they that are firm and ſtable, are an Ornament to the Temple of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Perpetuity</hi> and <hi>Conſtancy</hi> is here alſo promiſed to Overcomers; for Chriſt engageth to make ſuch <hi>Pillars, that ſhall go no more out of his Temple.</hi> Some take this to be ſpoken to anticipate the fears that might ariſe in their hearts, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Pillars of that famous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of old were broken down, and the Braſs of them carried away to</hi> Babylon <hi>by the</hi> Caldeans, Jer. 51.17. Hence fears might ariſe in ſome, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their preſent Settlement, they might afterward be utterly caſt out of God's Houſe. To prevent all ſuch Jealouſies of After-Apoſtacies, he aſſures them, <hi>They ſhall go no more out.</hi> It's true, thoſe that only ſeem to be Pillars and are not ſincere in the main, may, and will break and be utterly caſt down; as <hi>Judas, Demas, Julian,</hi> and many others were: But theſe were rotten Poſts, not
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:33830:113"/>real Pillars, and therefore were eaſily broken when the burden of Temptation was laid upon them: Hypocriſie will end in Apoſtacy. They went out from us, becauſe they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; but <hi>they went out from us, that they might be made manifeſt that they were not all of us,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. Here we ſee, Many are in the Viſible Church, who are not of the Church Myſtical; and theſe will manifeſt themſelves, at one time or other, what they are. Some were troubled to ſee ſo many forſake the Church, but he would not have them marvel at it; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: They were not right and ſound; if they had, they would never have done ſo. They now diſcover they were none of us, and ſo are the better avoided: We loſe nothing by their departure. The Corn loſeth nothing when the Chaff is gone, but is the purer; nor the Body when bad Humours are worn away, but is the more ſound and healthful; but yet
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:33830:114"/>every one that is upright ſhall ſo far overcome, as to continue his ſtation in the Myſtical Body of Chriſt. A true Believer may be ſo far worſted in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Combat, as to be caſt out of the Church by a Sentence of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that deſervedly; which was the caſe of the Inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Yet was not he totally and finally overcome by the Enemy, but was recovered by Repentance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the Communion of the Church again, and went no more out. <hi>Judas</hi> went out, and <hi>Demas</hi> forſook the Truth and Servants of Chriſt; but we find nothing of their Recovery, and riſing again by Godly Sorrow. Where there is no Root, there is no laſting Fruit; ſome haſty Bloſſoms, but they are ſoon nipt and quickly fall off. They are true ſincere Chriſtians, that are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to the end; <hi>Sampſon</hi> pulled down the Pillars of <hi>Dagon</hi>'s Temple, <hi>and the houſe fell, and all therein were ſlain,</hi> Judg. 16.29. But all the Powers of Earth and Hell combin'd ſhall not be able to deſtroy the Temple of God, nor utterly
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:33830:114"/>break one Pillar thereof. God gave his People charge to break down the Pillars that the Idolaters had ſet up, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.5. But Believers are Pillars of God's ſetting up, and none ſhall deſtroy any one of them. 'Tis true, if left to themſelves, they are like to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when God was departed from him; but as others, eaſily conquered by the aſſaults of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; as <hi>Peter</hi> reſolved to be more firm and conſtant than all men, <hi>Though all forſake thee, yet will not I,</hi> ſaies he; Yet how eaſily and quickly was he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to deny his Lord and Maſter? But being upheld by the ſtronger Pillars of God's Almghty Power, and immutable Covenant, they are not ſo totally routed and vanquiſhed as never to recover; but are renewed in their Life and Strength as <hi>Peter</hi> was: And as a Bone that hath been broken and once well ſet again is ſtronger than ever, ſo they gather ſtrength by their Falls, and are confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the truth and ways of God unto the end. This is the firſt thing here promiſed to Overcomers. The Second follows.</p>
            <pb n="194" facs="tcp:33830:115"/>
            <p>Bran. 2. Chriſt will give to ſuch, not only to be Pillars in his Temple, but excellent Names ſhall be by him written upon them. The Pillars in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple had very ſignificant Names en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven upon them, but theſe here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed are much more excellent. The Text mentions three; <hi>I will write upon him,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God, and my new Name.</hi> Of theſe briefly:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt will write upon the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comer the Name of his God. Some carry the ſenſe thus; He ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to belong unto God: As things written upon Pillars are made viſible and legible to all; or as things openly marked, declare their Title, and ſhew whoſe they are; So Chriſt will ſet Marks and Characters of God's Image upon them that are Victorious, ſuch as ſhall extort and force this acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment even from their very Enemies, who will he convinced in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and clearly ſee that they are the Servants and People of God. When Profeſſors are overcome by their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:33830:115"/>Pride, Worldlineſs, Paſſion, Uncharitableneſs, Injuſtice and Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in their dealings, Unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their words and promiſes, then the world writes other Names upon them; then they are called Hypocrites, Diſſemblers, Formaliſts, a people that make Religion but a cover for Vice, a cloak for Covetouſneſs and for Maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſeem better, but are worſe than mere civil and moral men. O, ſay they, we had rather truſt or deal with juſt honeſt men, though they make not ſuch ſhews of Religion, than with many great Profeſſors, who for a pretence make long Prayers as the Phariſees did, but none more unjuſt and falſe than they; they will ſay or do almoſt any thing to wrong and defraud another, to over-reach and go beyond another: Oh! that theſe things were not too juſtly and truly ſpoken of too many that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſtians, and Church-Members, <hi>Pudet haec opprobria nobis:</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when any get Victory over theſe Epidemical Evils, and manifeſt it by a conſtant acting in a contradiction to ſuch
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:33830:116"/>ſinful waies, then men will ſay, <hi>Ay, theſe are the people of God indeed; if there be any Saints upon Earth, theſe are ſuch; If all Profeſſors were ſuch as theſe, we would be among them our ſelves.</hi> Oh! how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable is it to ſee the day come, that is propheſied of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.14. when all they that <hi>have afflicted and deſpiſed the people of God, ſhall bow themſelves down at the ſoles of their feet, and call them the City of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Iſrael;</hi> They are Overcomers that muſt haſten the fulfilling of this: That which God promiſed, to put his Name in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. is made good to them, Chriſt will write his Fathers Name on their Foreheads.</p>
            <p>He alſo promiſeth to write upon him the Name of the City of his God, even the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which cometh down from God out of Heaven. There is a threefold <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> Terreſtrial, Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial, and Myſtical.
<list>
                  <item>1. The terreſtrial, or earthly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> called <hi>the City of</hi> David; <hi>The City of the great King,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 22.4. Pſal. 48.2. This City was once one of the Wonders of the World;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:33830:116"/>as the Gold among the Metals, ſo was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> among the Cities. Here the famous Temple was built; here was the Ark of the Teſtimony, and the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Covenant; the ſacred Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Prieſts wore: and it was the Seat of the great King, even God dwelt there. <hi>In</hi> Salem (that is, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) <hi>was his Tabernacle, and his Dwelling-place in</hi> Sion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.1, 2.</item>
                  <item>2. There is the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial, or Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> called a City, <hi>God hath prepared for Believers a City,</hi> Heb. 11.16. Of this ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that, Pſal. 87.3. <hi>Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O thou City of God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. There is the Myſtical <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is the whole company of Believers here, this is the <hi>City ſet upon a Hill,</hi> Mat. 5.14. and it is called <hi>The City of the Living God, the Heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. in regard of the Original of it, and by Right of Inheritance, as a Learned man ſpeaks.</item>
               </list> This is ſaid to come down from God out of Heaven, becauſe the Power and Mercy of God ſhall ſignally appear in building his Church, and making it glorious in the World. The two latter
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:33830:117"/>may be taken in here, though ſome wholly carry it to the laſt. The ſum is, Overcomers ſhall be enrolled as free Deniſon and Citizens of the New <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, No more to be Forreiners and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but Fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2.19. Even here on Earth their City is in Heaven, as is ſaid, Phil. 3.20. <hi>Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, our City-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and Behaviour <hi>is above.</hi> Some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it much to be Free of ſuch a City as <hi>London</hi> is, to have free Liberty to trade therein. O what a Favour is it then to have liberty of Acceſs to the great God of Heaven! To drive a free and full Trade Heaven-ward! to be Spiritual Merchants, who deal for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pearls of great price! This is better than the Merchandiſe of Silver, and the gain of thoſe things than fine Gold; <hi>They are more precious than Rubies, and all we can deſire are not to be compared with them,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.15, 16. And after all, you ſhall be taken up into the Celeſtial <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> You that have been Fellow-Soldiers here, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:33830:117"/>Overcome, ſhall be Fellow-Citizens there and Triumph: And though it will be a very glorious ſtate, he will bring his conquering Church into here, yet Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will be Heaven when all is done. Notwithſtanding this, the ſtate here promiſed, that they ſhall trade freely Heaven-ward, and be helped to order their Lives here as Citizens of Heaven, is an ineſtimable Priviledg. To have their Hearts in Heaven, their Diſcourſes of Heaven, (as the Primitive Chriſtians had the Kingdom ſo much in their mouths, that their Enemies were jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous they had evil Deſigns againſt the Civil Government; but it was the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom they talked of) their daily recourſes to Heaven, their being Heavenly in earthly things, their deſires to be in Heaven, and the like, ſhew that Chriſt hath written this Name upon them, that theſe are the Citizens of the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo that he that runs may read it. This is the moſt ſublime and noble ſtate, the moſt pleaſant and delightful, the moſt profitable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Divine Diſcoveries, to ſtrengthen
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:33830:118"/>their Graces, to encreaſe their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; this is the moſt ſafe eſtate for prevention of Temptations: becauſe hereby their Souls are taken up with high things, and not ſo apt to be taken in Satans ſnare; as the Bird that mounts aloft, is not in danger to be caught in the Fowler's Net. And in a word, It is the moſt ſuitable eſtate, for they look to go to Heaven when they dye, and expect a Saviour from Heaven at the laſt Day. Almoſt all they have of any worth is there already: Their Names are written in Heaven, their Treaſure is in Heaven, their chief Relations are in Heaven, their Inheritance is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and therefore to have a way and courſe of Life here, that is becoming a Citizen of that City, muſt needs be a choice and precious Mercy; and this is here promiſed to him that Overcomes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt further promiſeth to ſuch, That he will write upon them his new Name. Some underſtand it of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they ſhall ſhare in with Chriſt; When he had overcome, God gave him a Name above every name, the name
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:33830:118"/>of a King and Conquerour: So Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers ſhall be made <hi>Kings and Prieſts unto God, and ſhall reign on the Earth,</hi> Phil. 2.9. Rev. 1.6. Others take it to be meant of Adoption and Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But of this I have ſpoken in a former Sermon, <hi>A new Name written in the white Stone,</hi> Rev. 2.17. I come to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of this to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. See here the different eſtate of Believers and Unbelievers, of them that Overcome, and of them that are Overcome by the Enemy: Unbelievers have no part, no lot in theſe Promiſes. They may be in the Temple of God, and ſeeming Pillars there, but they will not continue long, but either go out, or be caſt out for ever; none of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Names ſhall be written on them, but Names of Contempt and Reproach. Believers ſhall have the Stability, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Perpetuity, and all the excellent Names here ſet down. O the Miſery of the one! O the Felicity of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! Who would be an Unbeliever ſtill? What ſhould diſcourage Believers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Let us all then ſtrive for the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:33830:119"/>If a man ſtrive for Maſtery, he is not crowned, except he ſtrive lawfully, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. and therefore much leſs they that ſtrive not at all. To move us unto Courage in this War, many things might be urged; Conſider,
<list>
                  <item>1. the Juſtneſs of the Cauſe: Though Soldiers be never ſo ſtrong and well furniſhed, yet if their Conſciences tell them they fight in a bad Quarrel, it will abate their Valour, and make them timerous. But our Cauſe is moſt juſt, and our War lawful; for God who is Juſtice it ſelf, hath proclaimed it by his Heraulds the Apoſtles; ſaying, <hi>Fight the good fight of Faith; Endure hardſhip as good Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt; Put on the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand and withſtand in the evil day; Reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee from you,</hi> 2 Tim. 6.12. 2 Tim. 2. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 6.10, 11. Jam. 4.7. Beſides, the Glory of God and the Salvation of our Souls lye at the ſtake; our Enemies De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to diſhonour God, and to deſtroy us: And can there be a Cauſe of greater Importance? If we would not treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:33830:119"/>betray theſe by our Sloathfulneſs and Cowardice into the hands of our Enemies, let us enter the field, and never ceaſe our couragious fight, till we have obtained a full Victory.</item>
                  <item>2. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at this day are full of Rage and Wrath, and a time of great Trial ſeems to be at hand; terrible ſhakings there are already upon us: <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of an hour of Trial, which was the Perſecution under <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, as Expoſitors judge. Some write that <hi>Philadelphia</hi> was, <hi>Terrae motibus concuſſa,</hi> often ſhaken with Earthquakes; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of theſe proper natural Earthquakes as a City ſhe was liable to, ſhe was, as a Church, ſhaken by the violent Aſſaults of enemies. And it is the judgment of many Learned and Godly Men, that an Hour of Temptation is drawing on upon the preſent Reformed Churches of Chriſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> wherein they are like to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſhaken. Satan's rage and wrath he is come down in, is very great; and his great Agent, the Beaſt, ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. is very powerful, and his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers begin to boaſt and make Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:33830:120"/>ſaying, <hi>Who is like unto the Beaſt? Who is able to make war with him?</hi> We have heard of the Prophecy of the late Reverend Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>her,</hi> and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability there is of its accompliſhment, any one may ſee by the preſent dark Providences going over us; which if God ſhall order to come to paſs, O what terrible ſhakings will there be! Not the Earth only, but the Heavens will be ſhaken. <hi>The Pillars of the Earth are the Lords,</hi> ſaies <hi>Hannah, and he hath ſet the world upon them,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.8. Yet we read, that <hi>the Pillars of Heaven and Earth tremble,</hi> Job 9.6. and 26.11. By the Pillars of Heaven, ſome underſtand the Angels; by the Pillars of the Earth, Political Pillars, Kings and Princes; and Eccleſiaſtical Pillars, ſuch as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were. Whether they be State-Pillars or Church-Pillars, if Antichriſt once again prevail over us, they will be terribly ſhaken; Men and Angels will be filled with Amazement and Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Providences of God. I have read of one <hi>Simeon,</hi> who is ſaid to have been Prophetical, that he paſſing through
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:33830:120"/>a Temple, ſpake to the material Pillars, and Prophecying of an Earthquake, bid them <hi>Stand faſt, for they ſhould ſhortly be ſhaken.</hi> Things work in our days ſo ſtrangely, as without a Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, I may ſay, to all the Churches of Chriſt, to all that ſeem Pillars in the Temple of God, Stand faſt, for you ſhall ſhortly be ſhaken; God will ariſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to ſhake terribly the Earth: Stand ſure therefore, that ye be not worſted and overcome by the Adverſary.</item>
                  <item>3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Honour and Profit that will accompany this Victory, if ye get it: Great is the Reward laid up in all theſe Promſes; Everlaſting Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence will be the portion of all ſuch. <hi>Brevis eſt labor,</hi> as one ſaith, <hi>praemium vero aeternum.</hi> Earthly Soldiers will purchaſe Honour, and get their Pay with the hazard of Life; the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Captain, the Applauſe of People, or a little Money will make them courageous: What hazard then! Should not we run in fighting this good fight? who ſhall have the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, the Captain of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:33830:121"/>and the Praiſe of the bleſſed Angels, who obſerve and look upon us, how we quit our ſelves in this holy War? If it were only the preſent Profit and Benefit which will accrue to us, it ſhould move us to fight, how terrible ſoever it ſeems to fleſh and blood: For that is truely here verified, <hi>Pax Belli filia,</hi> Peace is the Daughter of War. We no ſooner enter the field to fight againſt theſe Enemies, but preſently we have Peace with God, and Peace of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; if not the ſenſe, yet the ground of it. What then ſhould the receiving of a Heavenly Kingdom move us to do? Satans pay to his Soldiers is but the Pleaſures of Sin for a Seaſon; the Honour and Profit of the world for a moment; and in the end everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction both of Body and Soul. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they who keep cloſe to Chriſt's Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, and overcome the Enemy, beſides what they have here, ſhall be filled with ſuch Rewards and Joys, as Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor Heart of man can conceive.</item>
               </list> Laſtly, We have ſure grounds of Victory, for our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:33830:121"/>are already overcome to our hand; Chriſt hath cooled their Courage, and abated their Strength: And he that calls us to the Fight, will help us to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; <hi>Deficientes ſublevat, &amp; vincentes coronat;</hi> When we faint he ſuſtains us, and crowns us when we overcome.</p>
            <p>Beſides, God gives us to ſee the end from the beginning; He ſhewed <hi>David</hi> the Victory before-hand, <hi>This uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Philiſtine,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>ſhall be as one of them,</hi> meaning the Lion and Bear he had ſlain, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.36. We may ſay, as the Church of old, <hi>Rejoyce not againſt me, O mine Enemy, for though I fall, yet I ſhall riſe again. She that is mine Enemy ſhall ſee it: ſhame ſhall cover her that ſaid unto me, Where is the Lord thy God? Mine eyes ſhall behold her, now ſhall ſhe be trodden down as the Mire in the Streets,</hi> Mic. 7.8, 10. Behold Earth's Triumph in the midſt of the Enemies Inſultations; to ſee this before-hand is ground of hope of Victory. Further, every piece of Armour ſpeaks them Conquerors; It is the Armour of God, the Armour of Righteouſneſs, and ſecures on the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:33830:122"/>right hand and on the left. Though <hi>Saul</hi>'s Armour was too cumberſome for <hi>David,</hi> yet this is fitted and ſuited ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to all that rightly take it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Their Girdle and Helmet of great Strength and Purity; Their Breaſt-plate ſuch as ſecures the Vitals of Godlineſs and Religion; Their Shoes impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though the way be ſtrewed with Thorns and ſharp Stones; Their Sword better than <hi>Goliah</hi>'s, and it may be ſaid of it moſt truely, <hi>There is none like it;</hi> Their Shield better than the Shields of the Mighty, quenching all the fiery Darts the Enemy can throw upon them. Moreover, Whatever fights againſt us, fight for us? <hi>All theſe things are againſt me,</hi> ſaies <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 42.32. yet found all for him; whatever reſiſts Believers in a Conflict, doth encourage them: Their former and preſent Trials beget future Truſt; Their former Aſſaults are their after Experiences. By theſe they learn how to ward off ſuch a Blow, how to evade ſuch a Snare and Stratagem, how to withſtand ſuch a Temptation; and to add no more, In their Inability
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:33830:122"/>lies their Ability; out of weakneſs they are made ſtrong, and wax valiant in fight, as they of old, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.34. Many are valiant to fight at firſt, but to grow ſtrongeſt at the laſt piece of Service, to ſo ſay as St. <hi>Paul, When I am weak, then am I ſtrong;</hi> this is encouraging indeed. Theſe and other grounds of Victory Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have; let all ſuch ſtand and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in the evil day, for you ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly overcome at laſt. Aſſurance of Victory will make a Coward fight ſtoutly and courageouſly. O let not your hands be weakned, or your hearts faint and fail, ſeeing you are ſure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. There is a notable Speech of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who (venturing into apparent danger in War, was diſſwaded from hazarding himſelf, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſt if he were killed, the whole Army ſhould be rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and broken) ſaid, <hi>An Emperour was never ſhot through with a Bullet.</hi> Let the hearts and hands of Believers be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this. A true Believer was never totally and finally overcome by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of his Soul; but though foiled, and his Weapons beaten out of his hand,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:33830:123"/>yet recovers and ſtands when they are fallen and deſtroyed: Only be ſtrong and of a good courage, put forth your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to overcome. <hi>Qui creavit te ſine te, non ſervabit te ſine te,</hi> was the Saying of an Antient. It is not Armour in the Magazine, but put on and well uſed, that defends us and offends our Enemies.</p>
            <p>This Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> had but a little ſtrength, yet improving it well kept Chriſt's word, and denied not his Name; <hi>For to him that hath, ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> If a man hath Faith in the Habit only, though it were as ſtrong as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s, yet it will do little towards a Victory: but Faith, though but as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, yet in lively exerciſe will do wonders. Hence it is, a ſtrong Believer that ſuffers ſloth and ſecurity to grow upon him, will fall before the Enemy; when the weak Chriſtian, improving his little Strength, ſhall be victorious and get the better of him. If any object, we find the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my too ſtrong for us, as the Sons of <hi>Zeruiah</hi> were too ſtrong for <hi>David;</hi> ſo
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:33830:123"/>may ſome ſay, The evil Heart within, Satan and the World without are too hard for me, I ſhall never overcome, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of</hi> Saul, by the Policy and Power of my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Let ſuch look to their Captain for freſh Auxiliaries, and fear not; God gave St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and will thee, Victory; not for, or by thine own Endeavours, though they muſt be uſed, but through Jeſus Chriſt. Particularly,
<list>
                  <item>1. Through the Strength of Chriſt: <hi>I can do all things, and ſuffer all things too,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me,</hi> Phil. 4.13. A Chriſtian in Chriſt walks up and down the world like a Conquerour; but <hi>without him they can do nothing,</hi> John 15.5.</item>
                  <item>2. Through the Blood and Croſs of Chriſt. 'Tis ſaid that when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was going to fight againſt his Enemies, the Sign of the Croſs appeared to him, with theſe words written upon it, <hi>By this ſhalt thou Overcome.</hi> I know no Vertue to be in the Sign of the Croſs; but I read the Saints overcame the Dragon by the Blood of the Croſs, that Blood of the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:33830:124"/>Lamb ſhed upon the Croſs; Chriſt's Blood is Sin-conquering, Satan-ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and World-overcoming Blood.</item>
                  <item>3. Through the Word of Chriſt. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That Young men having the Word of God abiding in them, overcome the wicked One,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.14. Young Saints by this applied and improved, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome old <hi>Adam;</hi> yea, that old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the Devil.</item>
                  <item>4. By the Love of Chriſt. Believers are ſaid to be <hi>more than Conquerours, through him that loved them,</hi> Rom. 8.37. Many waters cannot quench the flame of this Love, nor the floods drown the ſenſe of it: Love is ſtrong as Death, and Death overcomes all, none can ſtand before it.</item>
                  <item>5. By the Victory of Chriſt; Hence he doth cheer up the hearts of his troubled Diſciples, ready to faint at the conſideration of his Departure from them, and the Hatred of the world againſt them; <hi>Be of good comfort, I have overcome the world.</hi> This he did as a publick Perſon, for himſelf, and for his Church, and every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it. When Satan conquered the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> he overcame all Mankind,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:33830:124"/>all being in him their Head and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative So all in Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> do and ſhall Overcome by his victory. Therefore be of good cheer, <hi>I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world;</hi> As if he had ſaid, My Victory is yours, and for you: elſe if they had no Intereſt in it, what ſupport could this give to them? Well then, Let all that are of a fearful heart, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to fight, as if they had no Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, no Chriſt; yet to rely on the Strength, Blood, Word, Love and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of Chriſt, as if they had not ſtruck a ſtroke; ſo ſhall they certainly Overcome their Enemies, and enjoy the good of theſe Promiſes.</item>

            <p>THis is the laſt, though not the leaſt, of thoſe Seven Promiſes made to Overcomers in this and the former Chapter. It is directed to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> verſ. 14. This Angel ſome think was <hi>Archippus,</hi> who had declined from his firſt life and activity in the work of the Miniſtry; Hence the Apoſtle Paul bad ſome ſay to <hi>Archippus, Take heed to thy ſelf, and to thy miniſtry that thou haſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:33830:125"/>received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it,</hi> Col. 4.17. <hi>Laodicea</hi> was a City nigh to the <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> and the Church planted there ſeems more corrupt than any of the other: In ſome there is much commended, and ſomething reprehended; In others no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reproved, but much commended: Here much reproved, nothing of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. The ſum of the Epiſtle is to diſcover her Sins, and perſwade to repentance: The ſins were two,
<list>
                  <item>1. A deteſtable neutrality in their Chriſtian profeſſion, at the 15 verſe, <hi>Thou art nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cold nor hot;</hi> as if he had ſaid, thou art indifferently affected, neither eager for the truth, nor an open Enemy to it; Neither a zealous profeſſor, nor a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Enemy to Religion; but a neuter, <hi>halting betwen two,</hi> as they, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21.</item>
                  <item>2. Pride and ſelf-conceit, in the 17 verſe, <hi>Thou ſayeſt I am rich, and encreaſed with goods, and have need of nothing,</hi> &amp;c. as if he had ſaid, Thou doſt boaſt as if thou wert rich in all manner of ſpiritual Grace, that nothing need be added to that perfection thou haſt attained, when thou vaunteſt thus, being ignorant of thine own lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:33830:126"/>ſtate, not knowing that thou art poor, and beggarly; yet poor and proud like a beggar boaſting of wealth; ſo true of her was that of <hi>Solomon, There is that maketh himſelf rich, and yet hath nothing,</hi> Prov. 13.7.</item>
               </list> And ſome think that the reaſon why no fault was mentioned in ſome Churches, was not becauſe there was no imperfection in them, but to ſhew how much the Lord favoureth humble modeſty; and nothing commended in <hi>Laodicea,</hi> not becauſe there was nothing good among them, but to ſhew how much the Lord diſliketh a luke-warm tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and a proud vain-glorious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe were her ſins; Now Chriſt perſwades to repentance by many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<list>
                  <item>1. From his own Omniſcience, verſe 15. <hi>I know thy works, that thou art neither hot nor cold;</hi> as if he had ſaid, though thou beeſt careleſs, yet I care; though thou takeſt no notice, yet I do; I obſerve what temper thou art of, and how doubly thou dealeſt by me.</item>
                  <item>2. By an argument drawn from the loathſomneſs of this ſin, verſe 16. <hi>Becauſe thou art neither cold nor hot, I will ſpew thee out of my mouth:</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:33830:126"/>Though they might think it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to deal thus deceitfully with God, they might account it a piece of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be thus moderate, as ſome call it; But I have other thoughts of it, it is a filthy abominable ſin, I will ſpue thee out of my mouth for it, if thou beeſt not zealous and repent: a plain expreſſion, intimating the loathſomneſs of it; as we ſpit at that which is loathſom to our Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, ſo does the Lord by this declare how much he abhors this ſin in our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</item>
                  <item>3. From the preſent inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it brought upon her; verſe 17. It brings them into a miſerable condition; They had a ſeeming ſhew to be rich, and wife, and happy, and full, <hi>when they were poor, and blind, and wretched, and naked.</hi> A ſhew of Religion makes men think they are in a good eſtate, and want nothing; but becauſe it is but a ſhew, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the more indigent and neceſſitous.</item>
                  <item>4. From the riches of his own Grace, verſe 18. <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou maiſt be rich,</hi> &amp;c. Would men come off in good earneſt to Jeſus Chriſt, and cleave to him in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:33830:127"/>they need not make ſuch poor ſhifts as they do; they need not make ſuch formal counterfeit ſhews as they do: to bear up their heads in the world, he would enrich them to purpoſe; they need not be aſhamed to walk in the midſt of their Enemies who wait to ſee their ſhame, he would cloath them effectually:</item>
                  <item>5. From an inſinuating motion; if they will not, he muſt take another courſe with them: if they will not come home willingly, he muſt fetch them home with a rod; <hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, be zealous therefore and repent,</hi> ver. 19. as if he had ſaid, if there be no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, though he dearly loved them, yet he muſt rebuke and chaſten them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they would avoid this chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let them be more zealous.</item>
                  <item>6. From his own importunity, the longing deſire he had to do good to their Souls; <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock,</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 20. as if he had ſaid, How fain would I bleſs your Souls with real bleſſings? How fain would I make over my grace and love to you, but you deprive your ſelves of it by your Hypocriſy, and Neutrality? <hi>Behold,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:33830:127"/>I come once more to your doors, and ſtand and knock, if any man will open to me, I will come in, and ſup with him, and he with me.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. From the great honour and dignity he would raiſe thoſe up to that overcome theſe predominant evils: This is laid down in the Text; the ſum of which take in this propoſition.</item>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bra.</hi> 1. Chriſt overcame; It is he that ſpeaks theſe words in the Text, <hi>I overcame.</hi> All he encountred with, he got Victory over. He grapled with Satan and overcame him; <hi>He ouercame him,</hi> ſays the Scripture, <hi>that had the power of death, that is, the Devil,</hi> Heb. 2.14. This Seed of the Woman hath broke that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. The head is the place of policy in man, of power in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures. Chriſt hath got all the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:33830:128"/>power and policy of Satan, and cruſhed it under his feet. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.14. He ſpoiled Principalities and Powers; That is, the whole Hoſt of Hell, with all their train of Attillery were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diveſted of all their deſtroying power; <hi>He overcame ſin; coming in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, condemned ſin in the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.3. <hi>ſo that it cannot condemn any in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.1. He overcame them by bearing them away, as the word ſignifies, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. An alluſion to the ceremony of the Scape-goat, over whoſe head were confeſſed the ſins of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Goat let go into the Wilderneſs, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.21, 22. This ſhadowed Chriſt upon whom God laid the iniquities of all his people, who ſo bare them as to bear them away. One ſin ſunk the Angels that kept not their firſt eſtate into their preſent miſery, and they can never overcome it; yet Chriſt hath ſubdued all the iniquities of his people, <hi>and caſt them into the depth of the Sea,</hi> Mich. 7.19. He overcame the world; <hi>I have overcome the world,</hi> ſays he, <hi>John</hi> 16 33. He overcame the good things of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:33830:128"/>world by being dead to them; when they ſought to make him a King, he withdrew himſelf. He overcame the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil things thereof by the invincible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and patience of his life, for he meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endured the contradictions of ſinners againſt himſelf: and by the victorious power of his death, when he ſeemed to be overcome, but did never conquer more eminently than by it and the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it. He hath overcome the juſtice and wrath of God, by giving ſatisfaction; out of Chriſt it hath a dreadful quarrel and implacable controverſy; and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are often under fears of theſe, but Chriſts blood hath made it their friend: <hi>In Chriſt God ſits with a Rainbow round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Throne,</hi> Rev. 4.3. When God ſmelt a ſweet ſavour of reſt from <hi>Noahs</hi> Sacrifice, he promiſed never to drown the world again; and as a token he would be mindful of his Covenant, he put his Rain-bow in the Clouds: So in Chriſt there is a Rain-bow about Gods Throne; his Bench of Judicature is turned into a Throne of Grace. Chriſt overcame the. Law by fulfilling it; He obeyed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:33830:129"/>of it; Though he was the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, yet he was made under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. He was circumciſed and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a debtor to do the whole Law, which he perfectly fulfilled, and is in that ſenſe the end of the Law for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to every one that believeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. He endured the penalties of it alſo, by ſubmitting to the curſe of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us.</hi> To be under the Law is a ſtate full of danger and terror; Believers many times fear it will put in a black bill of indictment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; but Chriſts blood hath blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out the hand-writings againſt them: They are not under the Law as to its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed curſes, and intollerable penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Law it ſelf to every true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, is non-ſuited, as one faith well, by the death of the Law-maker: He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came alſo death and the grave; Not ſo deſtroyed it that Believers ſhall not dye; but unſtinged it, that it ſhall not deſtroy eternally. Hence the Apoſtles triumphant <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>O death where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:33830:129"/>God which giveth us the victory through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.55, 57. When a Bee hath faſtned her ſting in a mans fleſh and ſo loſt it, ſhe ever after (they ſay) turns a Drone. Death once faſtned its ſting in Chriſt who overcame the venom of it, and ever ſince it hath been like a Drone; it may hum and affright, but not really hurt a true Believer. Death is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, it overcomes the mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs and Potentates of the Earth, and and none can ſtand before it; yet Chriſt overcame it even upon its own ground; It got him into the priſon of the grave, but could not keep him there, <hi>it was not poſſible for him to be holden by it,</hi> Acts 2.24. <hi>And though it is the laſt Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, yet Death ſhall he ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of Victory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.26.54. Thus we ſee, that Chriſt overcame the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, either by reconciling them, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming them; either by making them friends, or leaving them impotent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bra.</hi> 2. After he had thus overcome, he ſate down with his Father in his Throne; The Text is expreſs for it: This is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:33830:130"/>expreſſed in the Scripture; <hi>He is ſometimes ſaid to ſit at the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in the Heavens,</hi> Heb. 8.1. <hi>Sometimes to ſit on the right hand of God,</hi> Mark 16. All amounts to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Four things are implied in it:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It notes Dignity: Superiors ſit, when Inferiors ſtand; <hi>The ancient of days,</hi> is ſaid, <hi>to ſit,</hi> Dan. 7.9. And God is deſcribed ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon a Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Thus Chriſt ſate down in his Fathers Throne,</hi> that is, he was advanced to great honour: The Angels never arrived to ſuch honour; <hi>To which of all the Angels did God ever ſay, ſit thou on my right hand?</hi> Heb. 1.13 .The very interrogation implies a negation, he never ſpake thus to any of them. It was great honour <hi>Solomon</hi> did his Mother, to cauſe her <hi>to ſit down at his right hand,</hi> 1 Kings 2.19. But Chriſt is raiſed to greater Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for <hi>the Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou on my right hand, till thine Enemies be made thy foot-ſtool, Pſ.</hi> 110.1. To ſuch a height of honour is he advanced, that God hath charged <hi>all the Angels to worſhip him,</hi> Heb. 1.6. At firſt made lower than the Angels, now above them.</p>
            <pb n="225" facs="tcp:33830:130"/>
            <p n="2">2. It imports Authority: <hi>Thou ſateſt in the Throne judging right,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.4. Thus God hath highly exalted Chriſt to be the judge of all the world; A throne he ſhall have in the Clouds, and he that once came to be judged, ſhall come the ſecond time to judge: <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all men ſhould honour the Son, as they honour the Father,</hi> John 5.22, 23. And to ſhew his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, 'tis ſaid, to him every knee ſhall bow, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. All things in Heaven, in Earth, and under the Earth, that is, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Men, and Devils are ſubject to the Name and Authority of the Lord Jeſus: <hi>And every tongue ſhall confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord to the glory of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. The Devils and wicked men ſhall at laſt be forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the Authority of Chriſt, and to ſay as <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate did, <hi>Viciſti Galilee,</hi> O Galilean, thou haſt overcome me; and all Saints and holy Angels ſhall with one conſent acknowledg and own him as the Lord, and as their Lord; And all this to the glory of God the Father,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:33830:131"/>which <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, though it ſignifies the great end of Chriſt's exaltation, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of God, yet ſome underſtand by it, that Jeſus Chriſt is exalted to the ſame Authority and Glory with the Father in Heaven, being now ſet down with him in his Throne, at his right hand.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It implies a ſettled continuance of Chriſt in this Honour and Authority; 'Tis ſaid that <hi>Joſephs</hi> Bow abode, or as ſome read, ſate in ſtrength, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.24. As ſtanding is a poſture that ſhews a man ready to go this way or that way, ſo a ſedentary geſture notes continuance or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding: Though man being in honour continued not, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. <hi>ult. Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in honour lodged not; whence ſome conjecture, <hi>Adam</hi> fell in the very day he was created; And though <hi>our days on the earth are as a ſhadow, and there is none abiding,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.15. Yet the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> abides and continues in the Fathers Throne for ever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It signifies Chriſt's reſting from all his Travels, Labours, Services, and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: As after much Labour a man ſits down and reſteth himſelf, even ſo Chriſt
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:33830:131"/>having finiſhed the work his Father gave him to do, a ceſſation from all trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Labours followed, and he ſhall know them no more. After Gods works of Creation were finiſhed, <hi>he reſted on the ſeventh day,</hi> Gen. 2.2. Thus alſo, when Chriſt had accompliſhed the works put into his hand, <hi>He entred into reſt, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his own works, as God did from his,</hi> Heb. 4.10. Some carry theſe words of Believers, they are ceaſed from ſins, who are entred into heavenly reſt; others, that Believers are ceaſed from all ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſorrows, being once in glory; All this is true, yet ſome take it for Chriſt his Reſt from all his labours and troubles; Though here he was a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief, yet being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to ſit with his Father in his Throne, is ceaſed from theſe for ever.</p>
            <p>Bran. 3. <hi>Overcomers ſhall ſit down with Chriſt on his Throne;</hi> ſo ſaith the Text; An alluſion, ſay ſome, to the practice of thoſe Eaſtern Kings, whoſe Thrones were made large and capacious after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Couch; ſo that beſides the Kings place, others whom the King would ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:33830:132"/>might ſit down with him in the ſame Throne: what this Throne of Chriſt is, there are various conjectures; The Kingdom of Grace ſay ſome; <hi>we are made Kings and Prieſts, and reign on the Earth,</hi> Rev. 5.10. That is, have Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Sin, Satan, and the World; But this is Chriſt ſitting on the Throne of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, rather than our ſitting with Chriſt in his Throne, ſay others, who therefore will have it meant of his Throne in Heaven: But there Chriſt hath no Kingdom diſtinct from the Father, for having once ended that great tranſaction of the laſt judgment, <hi>he ſhall deliver up the Kingdom to his Father, and God ſhall be all in all,</hi> Cor. 15.24.28. Not that then Chriſt ſhall lay aſide his humane nature, as ſome have thought; but that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent mediatory Kingdom ſhall give place to the eſſential Kingdom of the God-head; <hi>God ſhall he all in all;</hi> not perſonally <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, but eſſentially, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Divine being, the Father, Son, and Spirit, ſhall be all in all, that is, communicate himſelf to the glorified Church, without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Ordinances and Creatures, and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:33830:132"/>alſo without the proper and immediate exerciſe of the Office of the Mediator: For when the difference between God and the Creature is compleatly made up, what formal need will there be of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator? For we cannot make a Mediator of one, nor of thoſe that are made one; It is an Apoſtolical maxim, <hi>A Mediator is not of one,</hi> Gal. 3.20. But if any ſay, how then is the Kingdom of Chriſt everlaſting? I anſwer, this doth not at all hinder it, for he hath victory over all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world, all the four Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies being fully conquered by him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. and the Goſpel of his Kingdom is vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally everlaſting, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. And Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers by vertue of it, ſhall poſſeſs ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory: neither ſhall this reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kingdom be any diminution to his glory; for the ſong in Heaven will be, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> &amp;c. Rev 5.11, 12. Others under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this Text, of a Temporal and Viſible Throne and Kingdom to be erected in this World before the laſt Judgment. <hi>If theſe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:33830:133"/>words,</hi> ſaith an excellent Divine, <hi>Do not intimate a reigning time for Chriſt's Church on earth, I do not at all underſtand them;</hi> Whether there ſhall be a perſonal conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Chriſt on earth for a Thouſand Years, as ſome hold, is very hard to be proved from the Scripture: Yet that there will be a glorious time for the Church on Earth, before the end of all things, is very clear. The 60 Chapter of <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaks it fully, thoſe Promiſes wait for the full accompliſhment: <hi>Great ſhall he the day of Jezreel,</hi> Hoſ. 2. <hi>ult.</hi> This is the world to come, as ſome judge, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5. Then ſhall Knowledg abound and cover the Earth, as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do the Sea. Some obſerve, that the Girdle was about the Loins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.15. But then about the Paps, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13. to ſignifie how Knowledg ſhall riſe higher in the laſt, than former Ages of the World: Then will Holineſs encreaſe, <hi>All the Pots in the Lords Houſe ſhall be holy, and Holineſs written on the Bells of the Horſes,</hi> Zech. laſt. Then there will be an end of differences amongſt God's people; Now <hi>Ephraim</hi> is againſt <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:33830:133"/>
               <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Judah;</hi> but then the the Lord ſhall be one, and his Name one: Then will come down the new Heavens and the new Earth, wherein ſhall dwell Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Now men ſay, <hi>Quod libet, licet; Sic volo, ſic jubeo;</hi> but then <hi>Judges as at the firſt, and Counſellors as at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; Kings Nurſing Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhall run down as Waters, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as a mighty Stream; then ſhall Antichriſt's Throne be utterly broken; That implacable Enemy ſhall fall and riſe no more: And then will the Kingdom of Chriſt be enlarged, <hi>The Kingdoms of this world ſhall become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt,</hi> Rev. 11.15. The Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall be more obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable and viſible than ever. We are not to expect a Kingdom, <hi>de novo,</hi> but the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and enlargement of that already extant: And though the Glory of his Kingdom is eclipſed, yet it will be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred conſpicuous to all, when he ſhall not Reign in a corner, but over the whole World: God hath ſet his King long ſince upon his holy Hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> all Power in
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:33830:134"/>Heaven and Earth was given to him at his Reſurrection; ſo that Chriſt hath been in his Throne many hundred years, yet it ſhall grow and prevail, till all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Oppoſers be put down, and his Kingdom appear in its Beauty in this world; though it will not be of the world, neither will the Saints have world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Troubles, nor worldly Joys, but ſhall have Heavenly Thrones; I mean their Thrones ſhall be in Heaven upon Earth: Then ſhall Overcomers know better than now they can apprehend, how great the Mercy here promiſed is, to ſit with Chriſt in his Throne. If any ask, why Chriſt will thus priviledge them, the Anſwer is, from his free Grant; ſo ſaies the Text, <hi>To him that Overcometh will I grant:</hi> Nothing more free than a Grant from a King. All this Charter contained in theſe ſeven Promiſes, is from the Royal Grant of the King of Saints. Not for the Battles they have fought, not for the Victories they have gotten; but all flow from the Fountain of Free-Grace: All that was done well, was done by his aſſiſtance. So then it will not be their
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:33830:134"/>Merit, but his Mercy; not of Debt, but of Grace; when they are ſate down in his Throne with him, they will and muſt cry, Grace, Grace. The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If theſe things be thus, Then let us all examine whether we be in the number of thoſe that ſhall inherit the good of this, and all the Promiſes we have heard of: If any ſay, How ſhall we come to an aſſured Intereſt in them? The Anſwer is, All depends upon our being victorious, they are all entailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Overcomers. Let us then to ſecure our Title to the one, clear the truth of our being in the number of the other, by diſcerning the ſoundneſs of our Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever is born of God overcometh the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4. and all that is in the world; the God of the world, the Men of the world, and the Luſts of the world: without this work wrought in us, any of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will ruine us. When the Sons of <hi>Sceva</hi> thought to prevail, by adjuring the evil Spirit by the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> Preached; the Spirit anſwered them, <hi>Jeſus I know, and Paul I know, but who
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:33830:135"/>are ye? And the men in whom the evil Spirit was, leaped upon them and overcame them, ſo that they fled naked and wounded,</hi> Acts 19.14, 15, 16. As if he had ſaid, I know Jeſus to be the Son of God, and <hi>Paul</hi> to be the Servant of God; the one may command me, the other may in his Name compel me, but who are ye? Have you the Power, Grace, and Spirit of Jeſus or <hi>Paul?</hi> He knowing they wanted this, overcame them; And ſo will Satan conquer all unregenerate ones. Let us then be looking diligently to our ſelves, leſt we fail of this Grace of God; All depends upon it as to Victory. O let us take heed leſt our New-birth prove a falſe Conception, leſt <hi>Ephraim</hi>-like we be unwiſe Sons, that <hi>ſtay long in the place of breaking forth of Children,</hi> Hof. 13.13. Many throws and pangs ſome have, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions tending to Converſion; yet they go away, and the Soul not born of God. Many go on in a way of Profeſſion all their days, and yet are not New-born; are not in the Spiritual Genealogy. And what do an Hundred Cyphers ſignifie without a Figure? Juſt nothing. To
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:33830:135"/>the ſame reckoning will all our external Religion come, without the New-birth: Above all things let us be careful leſt we be deceived herein. And truely he had need be as wiſe as <hi>Solomon,</hi> to find out the true Mother. Three or four things there are that deceive People;

                  <item>1. They have been convinced of Sin in a Legal way, and much troubled, and therefore hope they are born of God; But this is many a mans miſtake to reſt in them; They are troubled for Sin under the Word or Rod, yet ſin again. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael, when God ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they returned and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired early after God: Nevertheleſs, they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue: For their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 78.34, 36, 37.</item>
                  <item>2. Some miſtake in the point of good diſpoſition; They are well-enclined men, good-natured and hopeful men; but was not Chriſt's words to ſuch an one, Joh. 3.3. <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God?</hi> Why did Chriſt put him in mind
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:33830:136"/>of this? Why, becauſe he was a well-enclined and diſpoſed man, and did reſt too much upon it; therefore Chriſt tells him where his danger lay.</item>

Some plant the bottom of their Chriſtianity upon Forms, in things that are but the husk, the Varniſh and Plaiſtering of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: They think it enough to go to an Ordinance, to keep their Church, to be Baptized, to come to the Lord's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to be able to give an account of the Lord's Prayer, Creed, and Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to ſuch I may ſay, as Chriſt did to the Phariſees, <hi>Theſe things you ought to have done, but not leave the other undone.</hi> God did appoint theſe things, that men ſhould have a Form of Godlineſs; but we muſt not take the Skin for the Body, nor the Shadow for Subſtance; <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion avails any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature,</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. 6.15. Think not to ſay within your ſelves, <hi>We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father:</hi> Do not think, that becauſe you are edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the Proteſtant Religion, under the means of Grace, that therefore you are born of God.

God may ſanctifie ſome even from the Womb, but there is ſomething daily to be put away in all that are Regenerate; and though they cannot tell the firſt time, yet they can ſay it is often done; they do not turn to God once, but more and more, they have a great deal to do ſtill.</item>

Do the ſeveral Faculties of our Souls in their place and order wage war againſt Sin? In unſound hearts one Faculty fights againſt a Luſt, another contends for it; <hi>Herod</hi>'s Conſcience fought againſt the motion <hi>Herodias</hi> made of cutting off <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Head, his Affections ran counter to his Conſcience; this was no true Spiritual War: When both are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, that Soul will be a Conqueror in the end.</item>

So long as it does, <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitare,</hi> lye hard and heavy upon thee, as a thing out of its proper place, and make thee cry out as <hi>Paul, O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me,</hi> thou art an Overcomer in God's account.

If there be a <hi>Nolle peccatum,</hi> a bent of heart againſt Corruption and Temptation, thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueſt them to Death, and wouldſt be
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:33830:138"/>glad of an utter extirpation of them, then God accepts the Will for the Deed, and reckons thee a Conqueror. Though the Damſel under the Law was abuſed, yet if ſhe made the utmoſt reſiſtance ſhe was able, and cried out, and there was none to help her, ſhe was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Innocent and Guiltleſs; becauſe ſhe was forced, and not free and voluntary in it. <hi>Whatſoever is born of God Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh;</hi> it's not ſaid , Whoſoever, but <hi>Whatſoever:</hi> The perſon may be in particular Battles worſted by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, yet the principle is a Conqueror in the end, and will prevail; for it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yields, but makes implacable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: cries out to Heaven for help, and is on this account eſteemed an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomer. And therefore though we are ſtill aſſaulted, yet it is that we may be exerciſed, that we may ſtand upon our Guard, and watch and pray conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually; we muſt keep our Armour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and not be ſecure, for then the Enemy gets advantage againſt us: Our Enemies are like to that famous Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Marcellus,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, he was
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:33830:139"/>never quiet, <hi>Nec Victor, nec victus;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Conqueror, nor Conquered: Let it be enough to know, they are, and ſhall be ſubdued effectually in due time. Above all things deſpair not of Victory, when we find them turbulent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious. Many Creatures ſtruggle moſt when dying; The Devil rageth moſt when he is about to be caſt out, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.15, 16. No Believer ſo overcomes here, as to ſay, He ſhall meet with no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſſaults. Our contendings are not to empty a Pit, that is more eaſily done; but to dry up a Spring and Fountain, which is very difficult, if poſſible, in this caſe; but Corruption will be bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and Temptations ſpringing. And though a man hath overcome a Fit of Sickneſs, yet he cannot ſay he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſick again; for he may have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſtempers, and be ſick again even of the ſame Diſtemper; yea, and be brought low by it. So I may ſay here, A Believer, after he hath gotten a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Victory over his Enemies, yet cannot ſay, I ſhall never be aſſaulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by this or that Luſt or Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:33830:139"/>For that may be, and thou be brought low thereby: Be not ſecure, but watchful. But here lies the great Comfort, though a man may be under the ſame Affliction, that he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been recovered from, yea, and dye of it alſo; yet I may aſſure all true Believers, That their Sickneſs is not unto Death, as Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Lazarus;</hi> It may bring them low, but never to hurt them by the Second Death. You cannot ſay as <hi>Alexander, Veni, vidi, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci;</hi> I came, I ſaw, I overcame; but you may he exerciſed by theſe Enemies all your Life, and ſome have had the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt Combat in their dying hours; yet always true Believers go off Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. We read of a great Victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by <hi>Iſrael</hi> over the <hi>Syrians,</hi> yet at the return of the year the <hi>Syrians</hi> made another Invaſion, though it was to their utter Overthrow, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. Your Spiritual Enemies are like the <hi>Syrians,</hi> though they be often baffled, yet they will renew their Aſſaults. But as <hi>Joſhua</hi> made his Captains <hi>ſet their feet upon the necks of thoſe Kings,</hi> Joſh. 10.24. So
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:33830:140"/>will Chriſt, your Captain and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, who hath already won the Field, cauſe you to tread down the wicked, wicked Luſts, wicked Men, and Satan that wicked one, <hi>As aſhes under the ſoles of your feet,</hi> Mal. 4.3.</p>
            <p>Let us all labour to be Overcoming, that we may get Chriſt's Grant, to ſit with him in his Throne; <hi>Vincenti dabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> Look to get a principle of true Faith, this is the Victory whereby we Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, even our Faith; if we fail of the truth of this Grace, our enemies will ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruine us Inſtead of ſitting with Chriſt in his Throne, we ſhall be thrown out by Chriſt upon the Dunghil, and the Devil will everlaſtingly triumph over us. What will not men venture upon for Thrones and Kingdoms? Shall not a place in Chriſt's own Throne animate us to this holy War?</p>
            <p>To Conclude, You that are true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, you have begun to be Victorious, Go on Conquering and to Conquer. To this end,
<list>
                  <item>1. Beware of Diviſions; <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide &amp; Impera,</hi> Divide and Rule. An Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my divided is eaſily routed. Our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:33830:140"/>give our Enemies great advantage, as we have ſeen by ſad Experience. It was ſaid of old, <hi>Dum ſinguli pugnant, omnes vincuntur;</hi> whilſt they fought ſingle, they were all Overcome. Union is our ſtrength, O that at length Chriſtians would ſtudy to joyn Hearts and Hands againſt the Enemies. It was good Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in <hi>Joab,</hi> when he ſaw the Enemy had beſet them before and behind, he ſaid to his Brother, <hi>If the</hi> Syrians <hi>he too ſtrong for me, then thou ſhalt help me; but if the Children of</hi> Ammon <hi>be too ſtrong for thee, then I will come and help thee,</hi> 2 Sam. 10.11. So ſhould Chriſtians ſay to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, If Corruptions be too ſtrong for us, you ſhall come and help us; and if Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations be too ſtrong for you, we will come and help you: This would much weaken the hands of our Enemies, and make us more and more Victorious.</item>
                  <item>2. Give Chriſt the glory of every Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and he will give us to go on yet Conquering and to Conquer.
